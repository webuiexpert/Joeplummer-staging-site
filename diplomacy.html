                        one state becomes so strong that it dominates all the others and creates an
                        empire, or no state is ever quite powerful enough to achieve that goal. In the
                        latter case, the pretensions of the most aggressive member…are kept in check by
                        a combination of the others; in other words, by the operation of a balance of

                        “The Monroe Doctrine, proclaimed in 1832, made a moat of the ocean which
                        separated the United States from Europe. Up to that time, the cardinal rule of
                        American foreign policy had been that the United States would not become
                        entangled in European struggles for power. The Monroe Doctrine went the next
                        step by declaring that Europe must not become entangled in American affairs. And
                        Monroe’s idea of what constituted American affairs – the whole Western
                        Hemisphere – was expansive indeed…It declared that the United States would
                        regard any extension of European power ‘to any portion of this hemisphere as
                        dangerous to our peace and safety.’”

                        36: Evolution of
                        the Monroe Doctrine:
                        “In 1823, the Monroe Doctrine had warned the European powers to keep out of the
                        Western Hemisphere. By the time of the Monroe Doctrine’s centennial, its meaning
                        had been gradually expanded to justify American hegemony in the Western
                        Hemisphere. In 1845, President Polk explained the incorporation of Texas into
                        the United States as necessary to prevent an independent state from becoming ‘an
                        ally or dependency of some foreign nation more powerful than herself’ and hence
                        a threat to American security. In other words, the Monroe Doctrine justified
                        American intervention not only against an existing threat but against any
                        possibility of an overt challenge – much as the European balance of power did.”

                        had to become an actor on the international stage. Roosevelt said as much in a
                        1902 message to the Congress: ‘More and more, the increasing interdependence and
                        complexity of international political and economic relations render it incumbent

                        our people believe that they have nothing to fear from the present contest, and

                        56-58: The
                        origins of balance of power:
                        “What historians describe today as the European balance-of-power system emerged
                        in the seventeenth century from the final collapse of the medieval aspiration to
                        universality – a concept of world order that represented a blending of the
                        traditions of the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church. The world was conceived
                        as mirroring the Heavens. Just as one God ruled in Heaven, so one emperor would
                        rule over the secular world, and one pope over the Universal Church…With the
                        concept of unity collapsing, the emerging states of Europe needed some principle
                        to justify their heresy and to regulate their relations. They found it in the
                        concepts of raison d’état and the
                        balance of power. Each depended on the other.
                        Raison d’état asserted that the wellbeing of the state justified
                        whatever means were employed to further it; the national interest supplanted the
                        medieval notion of a universal morality. The balance of power replaced the
                        nostalgia for universal monarchy with the consolation that each state, in
                        pursuing its own selfish interests, would somehow contribute to the safety and
                        progress of all the others…The earliest and most comprehensive formulation of
                        this new approach came from France, which was also one of the first
                        nation-states in Europe…the principal agent for this French policy was an
                        improbable figure, a prince of the Church…Cardinal de Richelieu, First Minister
                        of France from 1624 to 1642. Upon learning of Cardinal Richelieu’s death, Pope
                        Urban VIII is alleged to have said, ‘If there is a God, the Cardinal de
                        Richelieu will have much to answer for. If not…well, he had a successful live.’
                        This ambivalent epitaph would no doubt have pleased the statesman, who achieved
                        vast successes by ignoring, and indeed transcending, the essential pieties of
                        his age….Few statesmen can claim a greater impact on history. Richelieu was the
                        father of the modern state system. He promulgated the concept of
                        raison d’état and practiced it
                        relentlessly for the benefit of his own country.”

                        59-60: The 30
                        Years’ War:
                        “Richelieu came into office in 1624, when the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor
                        Ferdinand II was attempting to revive Catholic universality, stamp out
                        Protestantism, and establish imperial control over the princes of Central
                        Europe. This process, the Counter-Reformation, led to what was later called the
                        Thirty Years’ War, which erupted in Central Europe in 1618 and turned into one
                        of the most brutal and destructive wars in the history of mankind…As a prince of
                        the Church, Richelieu ought to have welcomed Ferdinand’s drive to restore
                        Catholic orthodoxy. But Richelieu put the French national interest above any
                        religious goals. His vocation as cardinal did not keep Richelieu from seeing the
                        Habsburg attempt to re-establish the Catholic religion as a geopolitical threat
                        to France’s security. To him, it was not a religious act but a political
                        maneuver by Austria to achieve dominance in Central Europe and thereby to reduce
                        France to second-class status…a victory for the Counter-Reformation was exactly
                        what Richelieu was determined to prevent. In pursuit of what would today be
                        called a national security interest and was then labeled – for the first time –
                        raison d’état, Richelieu was prepared
                        to side with the Protestant princes and exploit the schism within the Universal
                        Church.”

                        “The Habsburg rulers were men of principle. They never
                        compromised their convictions except in defeat…therefore, they were quite
                        defenseless against the ruthless Cardinal’s machinations…Emperor Ferdinand II
                        [had) almost certainly never heard of
                        raison d’état. Even if he had, he would have rejected it as blasphemy, for
                        he saw his secular mission as carrying out the will of God…Never would he have
                        conceded that divine ends could be achieved by less than moral means…A ruler
                        committed to such absolute values found it impossible to compromise, let alone
                        to manipulate, his bargaining position...

                    <p>
                        Richelieu treated Ferdinand’s faith as a strategic
                        challenge. Though privately religious, he viewed his duties as minister in
                        entirely secular terms. Salvation might be his personal objective, but to
                        Richelieu, the statesman, it was irrelevant…Richelieu was determined to prolong
                        the war until Central Europe had been bled white…That a prince of the Church was
                        subsidizing the Protestant King of Sweden [to] make war against the Holy Roman
                        Emperor had revolutionary implications as profound as the upheavals of the
                        French Revolution 150 years later…In order to exhaust the belligerents and to
                        prolong the war, Richelieu subsidized the enemies of his enemies, bribed,
                        fomented insurrections, and mobilized an extraordinary array of dynastic and
                        legal arguments…

                    <p>
                        So novel and so cold-blooded a doctrine could not possibly
                        pass without challenge…it was deeply offensive to the universalist tradition
                        founded on the primacy of moral law…One of the most telling critiques came from
                        the renowned scholar Jansenius, who attacked a policy cut loose from all moral
                        moorings: ‘Would he dare say to God: Let your power and glory and the religion
                        which teaches men to adore You be lost and destroyed, provided my state is
                        protected and free of risks?’ That, of course, was precisely what Richelieu was
                        saying to his contemporaries and, for all we know, to his God. It was the
                        measure of the revolution he had brought about that what his critics thought was
                        a reductio ad absurdum

                        was, in fact, a highly accurate

                        Demonstrating how well they had absorbed the cynical
                        methods of the master himself, Richelieu’s defenders turned the argument of
                        their critics against them. A policy of national self-interest, they argued,
                        represented the highest moral law; it was Richelieu’s critics who were in
                        violation of ethical principle, not he…it was Richelieu’s critics whose souls
                        were at risk. Since France was the most pure and devoted of the European
                        Catholic powers, Richelieu, in serving the interests of France, was serving as
                        well the interests of the Catholic religion…If, in evaluating a statesman,
                        reaching the goals he sets for himself is a test, Richelieu must be remembered
                        as one of the seminal figures of modern history. For he left behind him a world
                        radically different from the one he had found…following the Peace of Westphalia
                        of 1648, ending the Thirty Years’ War, the doctrine of
                        raison d’état grew into the guiding principle of European
                        diplomacy.”

                        justified his seizure of Silesia from Austria, despite Prussia’s heretofore

                        risk/reward analysis: if he conquered Silesia, would other states retaliate or
                        seek compensation? Frederick resolved the calculation in his favor. His conquest

                        enough to remove the threat. By contrast, the Tories believed that Great

                        not simply to protect the balance of power. The Whigs were of the view that

                        had actually occurred; the Tories reasoned that a policy of wait-and-see might
                        allow an aggressor to weaken the balance irreparably. Therefore, if Great
                        Britain wished to avoid fighting in Dover, it had to resist aggression along the
                        Rhine or wherever else in Europe the balance of power seemed to be threatened.

                        participation in permanent cooperative arrangements to enable Great Britain to
                        help shape events and to preserve the peace.”

                        Napoleon’s final defeat at Waterloo in 1815]…The need to rebuild the
                        international order had become even more urgent…Prince von Metternich served as
                        Austria’s negotiator…The King of Prussia sent Prince von Hardenberg, and the
                        newly restored Louis XVIII of France relied on Talleyrand…Tsar Alexander I,
                        refusing to yield the Russian pride of place to anyone, came to speak for
                        himself. The English Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, negotiated on Great
                        Britain’s behalf…These five men achieved what they had set out to do. After the
                        Congress of Vienna, Europe experienced the longest period of peace it had ever
                        known…This unique state of affairs occurred partly because the equilibrium was
                        designed so well that it could only be overthrown by an effort of magnitude too
                        difficult to mount. But the most important reason was that the Continental
                        countries were knit together by a sense of shared values. There was not only a
                        physical equilibrium, but a moral one. Power and justice were in substantial
                        harmony. The balance of power reduces the opportunities to use force; a shared
                        sense of justice reduces the desire to use force…Metternich presaged Wilson, in
                        the sense that he believed that a shared concept of justice was a prerequisite
                        for international order…”

                        technical question which had nothing to do with bringing about freedom.
                        Metternich considered guaranteeing rights to be a paradox: ‘Things which ought
                        to be taken for granted lose their force when they emerge in the form of
                        arbitrary pronouncements…Objects mistakenly made subject to legislation result
                        only in the limitation, if not the complete annulment, of that which is

                        “The weakness of collective security is that interests are
                        rarely uniform, and that security is rarely seamless. Members of a general
                        system of collective security are therefore more likely to agree on inaction
                        than on joint action; they either will be held together by glittering
                        generalities, or may witness the defection of the most powerful member, who
                        feels the most secure and therefore least needs the system. Neither Wilson nor
                        Castlereagh was able to bring his country into a system of collective security
                        because their respective societies did not feel threatened by foreseeable
                        dangers…To them, participating in the League of Nations or the European Congress
                        system compounded risks without enhancing security.”

                            further; the political elite in each respective country, regardless of
                            “agreements,” would intervene only
                            when they felt they had something to gain. Likewise, they would skirt their

                            worth. So, in the end, a global “collective-security” system would inevitably

                        “In 1854, the Great Powers were at war for the first time
                        since the days of Napoleon. Ironically, this war, the Crimean War, long
                        condemned by historians as a senseless and utterly avoidable affair, was
                        precipitated not by Russia, Great Britain, or Austria – countries with vast
                        interests in the Eastern Question – but by France…In 1852, the French Emperor
                        Napoleon III, having just come to power by a coup, persuaded the Turkish Sultan
                        to grant him the sobriquet of Protector of the Christians in the Ottoman Empire,
                        a role the Russian Tsar traditionally reserved for himself. Nicholas I was
                        enraged that Napoleon…should presume to step into Russia’s shoes as protector of
                        Balkan Slavs…Lord Palmerston, who shaped British foreign policy…was morbidly
                        suspicious of Russia…Austria, which had the most to lose from a war, proposed
                        the obvious solution – that France and Russia act as joint protectors of the
                        Ottoman Christians. Palmerston was eager for neither outcome. To strengthen
                        Great Britain’s bargaining position, he sent the Royal Navy to the entrance of
                        the Black Sea. This encouraged Turkey to declare war on Russia. Great Britain
                        and France backed Turkey.

                        The real causes of the war were deeper, however. Religious
                        claims were in fact pretexts for political and strategic designs. Nicholas was
                        pursuing the ancient Russian dream of gaining Constantinople and the Straits.
                        Napoleon III saw an opportunity to end France’s isolation and to break up the
                        Holy Alliance by weakening Russia. Palmerston sought some pretext to end
                        Russia’s drive toward the Straits once and for all.”

                        begun, was completed by Bismarck…No longer was there talk of unity of crowned
                        heads or of harmony among the ancient states of Europe. Under Bismarck’s
                        Realpolitik, foreign policy became a
                        contest of strength…He was convinced that Prussia had become the strongest
                        German state and did not need the Holy Alliance as a link to Russia. In his
                        view, shared national interests would supply an adequate bond…Bismarck
                        considered Austria an obstacle to Prussia’s German mission, not a partner in
                        it.”

                        which Richelieu had presented them – a policy divorced from any value system
                        except the glory of the state. And, just as with Richelieu, they did not know
                        how to deal with it or even how to comprehend its nature…The reasons for
                        Bismarck’s break with the Russian conservatives were much the same as those for
                        Richelieu’s debate with his clerical critics, the chief difference being that
                        the Prussian conservatives insisted on universal political principles, rather
                        than universal religious principles. Bismarck asserted that power supplied its
                        own legitimacy…Realpolitik for
                        Bismarck depended on flexibility and on the ability to exploit every available
                        option without the constraint of ideology.”

                        Prussian national interest required keeping open the option of making a deal
                        with France…To Bismarck, the convictions of the generation of Metternich had
                        turned into a dangerous set of inhibitions. [Leopold von Gerlach, a man to which
                        Bismarck “owed everything”, strongly disagreed with Bismarck’s policy. In
                        response to Gerlack’s criticism, Bismarck wrote] ‘I am prepared to discuss the
                        point of utility with you; but if you pose antinomies between right and
                        revolution; Christianity and infidelity; God and the devil; I can argue no
                        longer and can merely say: I am not of your opinion and you judge in me what is
                        not yours to judge.’ This bitter declaration of faith was the functional
                        equivalent of Richelieu’s assertion that, since the soul is immortal, man must
                        submit to the judgment of God but that states, being mortal, can only be judged
                        by what works. Bismarck did not reject…moral views as personal articles of
                        faith…but he denied their relevance to the duties of statesmanship by way of
                        elaborating the distinction between personal belief and
                        Realpolitik: ‘I did not seek the
                        service of the King…The God who unexpectedly placed me into it will probably
                        rather show me the way out than let my soul perish.’

                        Because of his magnificent grasp of the nuances of power
                        and its ramifications, Bismarck was able in his lifetime to replace the
                        philosophical constraints of the Metternich system with a policy of
                        self-restraint. Because these nuances were not as self-evident to Bismarck’s
                        successors and imitators, the literal application of
                        Realpolitik led to their excessive dependence on military power, and
                        from there to an armament race and two world wars.”

                        “German military planners always thought in terms of
                        fighting off a combination of all of Germany’s neighbors simultaneously. In
                        readying themselves for that worst-case scenario, they helped to make it a
                        reality. For a Germany strong enough to defeat a coalition of all its neighbors
                        was obviously also more than capable of overwhelming any of them individually.
                        At the sight of the military colossus on their borders, Germany’s neighbors drew
                        together for mutual protection, transforming the German quest for security into
                        an agent of its own insecurity…

                        Bullying tactics seemed to Germany’s leaders the best way
                        to bring home to their neighbors the limits of their own strength and,
                        presumably, the benefits of Germany’s friendship. This taunting approach had
                        quite the opposite effect. Trying to achieve absolute security for their
                        country, German leaders after Bismarck threatened every other European nation
                        with absolute insecurity, triggering countervailing coalitions nearly
                        automatically. There are no diplomatic shortcuts to domination; the only route
                        that leads to it is war, a lesson the provincial leaders of post-Bismarck
                        Germany learned only when it was too late to avoid a global catastrophe.”

                            military must “defend the American homeland” by fighting and winning “multiple,
                            simultaneous major theater wars.” They state that their goal is to further
                            extend “Pax Americana” by performing “constabulary” duties and preventing the

                        Foreign Office analyst, explained why, in his view, an accommodation with

                        that…Germany’s intentions were essentially irrelevant; what mattered were its
                        capabilities. He put forward two hypotheses: ‘Either Germany is definitely
                        aiming at a general political hegemony…threatening the independence of her
                        neighbours and ultimately the existence of England; or Germany, free from any
                        such clear-cut ambition…is seeking to promote her foreign commerce, spread the
                        benefits of German culture, extend the scope of her national energies, and
                        create fresh German interests all over the world wherever and whenever a
                        peaceful opportunity offers…’ Crow insisted that these distinctions were
                        irrelevant because, in the end, they would be overridden by the temptations
                        inherent in Germany’s growing power…Great Britain made it clear that it would

                        Schlieffen Plan saw to it that the initial battles would be fought in the West
                        between countries having next to no interest in the immediate crisis. Foreign

                        security put European diplomats on thoroughly unfamiliar terrain. The assumption
                        behind all European settlements had been that borders could be adjusted to
                        promote the balance of power, the requirements of which took precedence over the
                        preferences of the affected populations….Wilson entirely rejected this
                        approach…Wilson proposed to found peace on the principle of collective security.
                        In his view and that of all his disciples, the security of the world called for,
                        not the defense of the national interest, but of peace as a legal concept. The
                        determination of whether a breach of peace had indeed been committed required an
                        international institution, which Wilson defined as the League of Nations.

                        Oddly enough, the idea for such an organization first
                        surfaced in London, heretofore the bastion of balance-of-power diplomacy. And
                        the motive for it was not an attempt to invent a new world order but England’s
                        search for a good reason why America should enter a war of the old order. In
                        September 1915, in a revolutionary departure from British practice, Foreign
                        Secretary Grey wrote to Wilson’s confidant, Colonel House, with a proposal which
                        he believed the idealistic American President would not be able to refuse. To
                        what extent, asked Grey, might the President be interested in a League of
                        Nations committed to enforcing disarmament and to the pacific settlement of
                        disputes? ‘Would the President propose that there should be a League of Nations
                        binding themselves to side against any Power which broke a treaty…or which
                        refused, in case of dispute, to adopt some other method of settlement than that
                        of war?’

                        It was unlikely that Great Britain, which for 200 years had
                        steered clear of open-ended alliances, had suddenly developed a taste for
                        open-ended commitments on a global scale. Yet Great Britain’s determination to
                        prevail against the immediate threat of Germany was so great that its Foreign
                        Secretary could bring himself to put forward a doctrine of collective security,
                        the most open-ended commitment imaginable…

                    <p>
                        Grey knew his man. From the days of his youth, Wilson had
                        believed that American federal institutions should serve as a model for an
                        eventual ‘parliament of man’…Grey could not have been surprised – though surely
                        he was gratified – to receive a prompt reply falling in with what was, in
                        retrospect, his rather transparent hint. The exchange was perhaps the earliest
                        demonstration of the ‘special relationship’ between America and Great Britain…A
                        common language and cultural heritage combined with great tactfulness to enable
                        British leaders to inject their ideas into the American decision-making process
                        in such a manner that they imperceptibly seemed to be a part of Washington’s
                        own. Thus, when, in May 1916, Wilson advanced for the first time his scheme for
                        a world organization, he was no doubt convinced that it had been his own idea.
                        And in a way it had been, since Grey had proposed it in full awareness of
                        Wilson’s likely convictions.”

                        unconstitutional: ‘A war automatically arising upon a condition subsequent,

                        pitch which prevented the establishment of a conciliatory peace. Yet, in the

                        “The Western Allies remained oblivious to the temptations
                        they were creating for both Germany and the Soviet Union by pretending that
                        these two most powerful countries on the Continent could simply be ignored.
                        Three requests by the German Chancellor and his Foreign Minister for a meeting
                        with Lloyd George were rebuffed. Simultaneously, France proposed holding private
                        consultations with Great Britain and the Soviet Union from which Germany would
                        be excluded. The purpose of these meetings was to resurrect the shopworn scheme
                        of trading tsarist debts for German reparations – a proposal which even less
                        suspicious diplomats than the Soviets would have construed as a trap to
                        undermine the prospect of improved German-Soviet relations. By the end of the
                        first week of the conference, both Germany and the Soviet Union were worried
                        that they would be pitted against each other. When [one of the Soviet Foreign
                        Minister’s aids] telephoned the German delegation at the conspiratorial hour of
                        one-fifteen in the morning on April 16, 1922, proposing a meeting later that day
                        at Rapallo, the Germans jumped at the invitation. They were anxious to end their
                        isolation as much as the Soviets wanted to avoid the dubious privilege of
                        becoming German creditors. The two foreign ministers lost little time drafting
                        an agreement in which Germany and the Soviet Union established full diplomatic
                        relations, renounced claims against each other, and granted each other Most
                        Favored Nation status. Lloyd George, upon receiving belated intelligence of the
                        meeting, frantically tried to reach the German delegation to invite them to the
                        interview he had repeatedly rejected. The message reached Rathenau, the German
                        negotiator, as he was about to leave for the signing of the Soviet-German
                        agreement. He hesitated, then muttered: ‘The wine is drawn; it must be drunk.’”

                        include as many other nations as possible. The offer proved as irresistible as
                        it was meaningless. On August 27, 1928, the Pact of Paris (popularly known as
                        the Kellogg-Briand Pact), renouncing war as an instrument of national policy,
                        was signed with great fanfare by fifteen nations. It was quickly ratified by
                        practically all the countries of the world, including Germany, Japan, and Italy,

                        seize the world’s statesmen. France qualified its original proposal by inserting
                        a clause legalizing wars of self-defense and wars to honor obligations arising
                        out of the League Covenant, the Locarno guarantees, and all of France’s
                        alliances. This brought matters back to their starting point, for the exceptions
                        encompassed every conceivable practical case. Next, Great Britain insisted on
                        freedom of action in order to defend its empire. America’s reservations were the
                        most sweeping of all; it invoked the Monroe Doctrine, the right of self-defense,
                        and the stipulation that each nation be its own judge of the requirements of
                        self-defense. Retaining every possible loophole, the United States rejected
                        participation in any enforcement action as well.”

                        victors of the Napoleonic Wars had made a generous peace, but they had also
                        organized the Quadruple Alliance in order to leave no ambiguity about their
                        determination to defend it. The victors of World War I had made a punitive peace
                        and, after having themselves created the maximum incentive for revisionism,
                        cooperated in dismantling their own settlement.”

                        Eighteenth Party Congress, the first such meeting held since Stalin’s
                        endorsement of collective security and “united fronts” five years earlier. The
                        delegates’ feelings must have been dominated by relief at still being alive, for
                        the purges had decimated their ranks: only thirty-five of the 2,000 delegates
                        from the five years before were now in attendance; 1,100 of the remainder had
                        been arrested for counter-revolutionary activities; ninety-eight of the 131
                        members of the Central Committee had been liquidated, as had been three out of
                        five marshals of the Red Army, all eleven deputy commissars for defense, all
                        military district commanders, and seventy-five out of the eighty members of the

                        of continuity. Its attendees were vastly more concerned with the requirements of
                        their own personal survival than with the arcane subtleties of foreign policy.”

                        revisionism about the First World War. In 1935, a special Senate
                        Committee…published a 1400-page report blaming America’s entry into the war on
                        armaments manufacturers. Soon thereafter, Walter Millis’ best-selling book,
                        The Road to War, popularized the
                        thesis for a mass audience. Under the impact of this school of thought,
                        America’s participation in the war came to be explained by malfeasance,
                        conspiracy, and betrayal rather than by fundamental or permanent interests…To
                        prevent America from once again being lured into war, the Congress passed three
                        so-called Neutrality Acts between 1935 and 1937.”

                        “quarantine” and what, if any, specific measures he might have in mind. Had the
                        speech implied any kind of action, it would have been inconsistent with the
                        Neutrality Acts, which the Congress had overwhelmingly approved and the
                        President had recently signed…Not surprisingly, the Quarantine Speech was
                        attacked by isolationists, who demanded clarification of the President’s
                        intentions. They argued [it was leading] to the abandonment of the policy of
                        nonintervention, to which both Roosevelt and the Congress had pledged
                        themselves…Roosevelt could have ended the controversy by simply denying the
                        intentions being ascribed to him. Yet, despite the critical onslaught, Roosevelt
                        spoke ambiguously enough at a news conference to keep open the option of
                        collective defense of some kind. According to the journalistic practice of the
                        day, the President always met with the press off-the-record, which meant that he
                        could neither be quoted nor identified, and these rules were respected.”

                        of condemnation by posterity, whose claims he is neglecting. A leader who gets
                        too far ahead of his society will become irrelevant. A great leader must be an
                        educator, bridging the gap between HIS
                        visions and the familiar. But he must also be willing to walk alone to enable

                        selected. Roosevelt’s support for Britain and France was limited only when the

                        “In September 1941, the United States crossed the line into
                        belligerency. Roosevelt’s order that the position of German submarines be
                        reported to the British Navy had made it inevitable that, sooner or later, some
                        clash would occur. On September 4, 1941, the American destroyer Greer was
                        torpedoed while signaling the location of a German submarine to British
                        airplanes. On September 11, without describing the circumstances, Roosevelt
                        denounced German ‘piracy.’ Comparing German submarines to a rattlesnake coiled
                        to strike, he ordered the United States Navy to sink ‘on sight’ any German or
                        Italian submarines discovered in the previously established American defense
                        area extending all the way to Iceland. To all practical purposes, America was at
                        war on the sea with the Axis powers.

                        Simultaneously, Roosevelt took up the challenge of Japan.
                        In response to Japan’s occupation of Indochina in July 1941, he abrogated
                        America’s commercial treaty with Japan, forbade the sale of scrap metal to it,
                        and encouraged the Dutch government-in-exile to stop oil exports to Japan from
                        the Dutch East Indies

                        . These pressures led to
                        negotiations with Japan, which began in October 1941. Roosevelt instructed the
                        American negotiators to demand that Japan relinquish all of its conquests,
                        including Manchuria, by invoking America’s previous refusal to ‘recognize’ these
                        acts…Roosevelt must have known that there was no possibility that Japan would
                        accept. On December 7, 1941, following the pattern of the Russo-Japanese War,
                        Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor…”

                        abiding Yankee distrust of Great Britain. Like most American liberals since
                        Jefferson, he insisted that ‘the same moral principles which governed in private
                        life also should govern in international affairs.’ In Wallace’s view, America
                        had lost its moral compass and was practicing a foreign policy of ‘Machiavellian

                        Eastern border that the Arab nationalists did not recognize. The borders in

                        to facilitate their domination of the area. In the minds of the Arab
                        nationalists, these frontiers cut across the Arab nation and denied a common

                        can save a prince who undertakes to give relief to his subjects after long
                        oppression. The sufferings that are endured patiently, as being inevitable,
                        become intolerable the moment it appears that there might be an escape. Reform
                        then only serves to reveal more clearly what still remains oppressive and now
                        all the more unbearable.’

                        that overtook him so belatedly. After the Soviets crushed the revolution, they
                        offered Nagy the opportunity to recant. His refusal and subsequent execution
                        assured him a place in the pantheon of those martyred to the cause of freedom in

                        “In a conventional war with established front lines,
                        superior firepower usually carries the day. By contrast, a guerrilla war is
                        generally not fought from fixed positions, and the guerrilla army hides among
                        the population. A conventional war is about control of territory; a guerrilla
                        war is about the security of the population. Since the guerrilla army is not
                        tied to the defense of any particular territory, it is in a position to
                        determine the field of battle to a considerable extent and to regulate the
                        casualties on both sides.

                        The guerrillas’ initial goal is to prevent the
                        consolidation of stable, legitimate institutions. Their favorite targets are the
                        worst and the best government officials. They attack the worst in order to win
                        popular sympathies by ‘punishing’ corrupt or oppressive officials; and they
                        attack the best because it is the most effective way of preventing the
                        government from achieving legitimacy and of discouraging an effective national
                        service.”

                        The communist victory rapidly settled one of the perennial

                        in the wake of a communist takeover was a figment of the policymakers’ search
                        for pretexts to continue the war…In Cambodia, of course, genocide did occur…In
                        Vietnam, the suffering was less drastic. Still, hundreds of thousands of South
                        Vietnamese were herded into ‘re-education camps,’ another name for concentration
                        camps. In early 1977, communist authorities admitted to holding 50,000 political
                        prisoners, though most independent observers believed the true figure to be
                        closer to 200,000.”

                            brought about as a direct result of US intervention – including the agent-orange
                            / herbicidal warfare program – are taken into consideration. Is the “suffering”
                            of those millions of individuals factored in? How about the 50,000 + Americans
                            who died; were they sacrificed to prevent 50,000 – 200,000 political prisoners
                            from being “reeducated?” Should we have stayed until the US death toll reached
                            100,000 to prevent it?  Regarding the
                            Khmer Rouge’s atrocities; is it possible the destabilization of Cambodia had
                            something to do with their rise to power? The bottom line is the American people
                            did not want this war. It was forced on them by individuals like you;
                            practitioners or Realpolitik. It comes
                            off as pretty disingenuous when you repeatedly stress the superiority of
                            Realpolitik, but then retreat to the “good cause” when it’s

                            the manipulative language? When you say “the world” wants your ilk to construct
                            a new world order, which “world” are you talking about? Even the

                        capacity to do so and that both parties would do well to work at preserving that
                        neutrality. So too, when a nation expresses its ‘deep concern’ over a military
                        contingency, it is conveying that it will assist – in some as yet unspecified
                        way – the victim of what it has defined as aggression. Nixon was unique among
                        American presidents in this century by thus showing his preparedness to support
                        a country with which the United States had had no diplomatic relations for
                        twenty years…It marked America’s return to the world of

                        there had been any direct contact between Washington and Beijing – the report
                        called for practical negotiations with China and stressed that the United States
                        would not collude with the Soviet Union against China. This was, of course, the
                        reverse side of the warning to Moscow; it implied that Washington always had the
                        option if driven to it.”

                        States were taken completely by surprise, demonstrating how preconceptions often
                        shape intelligence assessments.” (This is nonsense. The Network, which obviously
                        included Kissinger, knew exactly what was coming. See William Engdahl’s

                        135, for more information. Here is a brief summary: “Contrary to popular
                        impression, the ‘Yom Kippur’ War was not the simple result of miscalculation,
                        blunder or an Arab decision to launch a military strike against the state of
                        Israel. The entire constellation of events surrounding the outbreak of the
                        October War was secretly orchestrated by Washington and London, using the
                        powerful secret diplomatic channels developed by Nixon’s national security
                        adviser, Henry Kissinger. Kissinger effectively controlled the Israeli policy
                        response through his intimate relation with Israel’s Washington ambassador,
                        Simcha Dinitz. In addition, Kissinger cultivated channels to the Egyptian and
                        Syrian side. His method was simply to misrepresent to each party the critical
                        elements of the other, ensuring the war and its subsequent Arab oil embargo…US
                        intelligence reports, including intercepted communications from Arab officials
                        confirming the buildup for war, were firmly suppressed by Kissinger, who was by
                        then Nixon’s intelligence ‘czar.’” Realpolitik…)

                        superiority in the Nuclear Age. But, whatever the accuracy of Reagan’s

                        of the general secretary of the Communist Party; from Lenin through Brezhnev,
                        the communist leader rarely held a governmental office. The result was that the
