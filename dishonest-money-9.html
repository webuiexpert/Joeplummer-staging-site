  <h1>CHAPTER NINE<br>How They Do It</h1>
</div>

<div class="Chapter-content">

          <p>OK, now it is time to show exactly <em>how</em> the Federal Reserve System creates money out of nothing.
            But before we do that, let's quickly recap the different forms of money discussed up to this point.</p>

          <h2><em>1. Commodity Money</em></h2>

          <p>Commodity money can be based on any commodity that people value.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"
              class="footnote">[1]</a> Sheep, cows, corn, wheat â€” all of these served as early forms of commodity
            money.</p>

          <p>When mankind discovered metal, it became a new (more convenient) form of commodity money. Unlike livestock,
            metal didn't need to be fed, watered, and cleaned up after. And, unlike wheat and corn, you didn't have to
            worry about metal going bad, becoming contaminated with bugs or mold, etc.</p>

          <p>Also, metal was easily divisible. Assuming a cow was equal in value to 100 pounds of iron, and an item was
            for sale valued at 10 pounds of iron (or one-tenth of a cow), the individual buying with iron had a distinct
            advantage; he could easily produce the exact amount of money needed.</p>

          <p>For these reasons, metal became the most common form of commodity money. Though different metals were used
            (iron, tin, copper, etc.), gold and silver coins became the standard.</p>

          <h2><em>2. Receipt Money</em></h2>

          <p>Gold and silver coins were a much-improved form of commodity money, but they still had some drawbacks. For
            instance, if you were even moderately wealthy, carrying all of your gold or silver coins around with you was
            cumbersome and potentially dangerous. Finding a place to safely hide your coins wasn't easy either.</p>

          <p>Seeing an opportunity to earn a little extra money, goldsmiths solved this problem by renting storage space
            in their vaults. When a citizen came in to deposit their coins, the goldsmith would give them a paper
            receipt as proof of their deposit. If a customer deposited $1,000 in gold coins, they were given a receipt
            (or receipts) valued at $1,000 worth of gold.</p>

          <p>These receipts were "payable on demand," meaning the depositor, at any time, could come in and exchange the
            receipts for their gold.</p>

          <p>Because the receipts were literally "good as gold," citizens began accepting them as payment for products
            and services. From that point forward, the receipts became a legitimate form of paper money, 100% backed by
            gold (or sometimes backed by silver).</p>

          <p>As time passed, it became increasingly rare for individuals to visit the goldsmith and demand coins in
            exchange for their receipts. (Although receipt holders had the right to exchange their receipts for gold at
            any time, they were happy to leave it locked up in the goldsmith's vault.) It was much more convenient to
            use the paper money, instead of the physical coins they represented, in commerce.</p>

          <h2><em>3. Fractional Money</em>:</h2>

          <p>At some point, goldsmiths realized that almost nobody came in to withdraw their coins, and this sparked an
            idea. Why leave all that gold gathering dust in the vault (earning only a small storage fee) when instead it
            could be loaned out at interest for a much greater profit?</p>

          <p>Since receipt money was already in use, the goldsmith wouldn't even have to remove the coins from storage.
            When a borrower came in seeking $1,000, the goldsmith could simply print up $1,000 worth of new receipts!
          </p>

          <p>This, of course, was an act of pure fraud. The goldsmith had no right to give the borrower (or anyone the
            borrower purchased from), a claim on somebody else's gold.</p>

          <p>Additionally, the <em>only</em> reason citizens accepted receipts as payment was because they believed the
            value stamped on every receipt was backed by an equal number of coins in storage. Unbeknownst to them, this
            was no longer the case.</p>

          <p>What began as legitimate receipt money (backed 100% by coins held in reserve) was now fractional money. By
            creating new receipts, the goldsmith had secretly driven down the percentage of reserves backing each
            receipt. (And with each new printing, the fraction became less and less.)</p>

          <p>Before long, citizens were unknowingly accepting receipts backed by only half of the printed value, a
            quarter of the printed value, a tenth of the printed value. When people finally figured out what was going
            on, they rushed to exchange their receipts for gold.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, only the first few in line were able to do so. The rest were left holding worthless paper
            receipts.</p>

          <h2><em>4. Fiat Money:</em></h2>

          <p>Encarta defines fiat money as: <strong>"</strong>paper money that a government declares to be legal tender
            although it is not based on or convertible into coins." Another way to put that would be: Fiat money is
            paper (backed by nothing), and because so, government <em>forces</em> people to accept it via legal tender
            laws.</p>

          <p>But believe it or not, there is actually something worse than fiat paper money. And this brings us to the
            final form of money we'll be discussing in this book. The form of money we're using today is:</p>

          <h2><em>5. Debt Money:</em></h2>

          <p>Take the inherently fraudulent characteristics of a fractional money system; add in the greater fraud of
            pure fiat, top it off with a mechanism designed to generate inescapable perpetual debt, and <em>presto</em>:
            You've got the greatest monetary fraud ever perpetrated against mankind. And, wouldn't you know, you also
            have all the components that make up our current monetary system. It is <em>dishonest money</em> at its
            worst.</p>

          <p>Rather than openly print money to cover their reckless spending, our politicians use a less obvious tactic.
            Make no mistake; they still end up creating money out of nothing. It's just that they use their friends at
            the Federal Reserve to do it for them. And in exchange for helping politicians get the money they want, the
            banking elite reap benefits that are nothing short of obscene.</p>

          <p>You see, unlike a normal fiat money system (where the government simply creates its own paper money, spends
            it into the economy, and demands everyone accept it), our entire money supply is built on
            <strong>debt</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>That means that not a single dollar comes into existence but by the act of <em>borrowing it</em> into
            existence. First, let me explain this in the simplest terms possible, and then we'll get into a more
            detailed explanation.</p>

          <p>Assume the politicians need (<em>want</em>) $1 billion. Rather than print the money, they go to their
            banking buddies at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is always happy to <em>loan</em> whatever amount
            of money the politicians ask for.</p>

          <p>The problem is the Fed doesn't actually <em>loan</em> anything. Yes, when the government shows up with its
            $1 billion bond, the Fed will give it a $1 billion check in exchange; but that $1 billion Federal Reserve
            check doesn't have anything backing it. The money (keystrokes in the Fed's computer system) is created on
            the spot out of thin air; <em>poof</em>, there it is.</p>

          <p>The government signs its new Federal Reserve check, deposits it in its Federal Reserve bank account, and
            immediately begins "paying its bills." (Writing checks to government contractors, bureaucrats, etc., and
            inflating our money supply by $1 billion in the process.) But that's just the beginning of the inflation.
            The government contractors, bureaucrats, etc., take their government checks and deposit them in
            <em>their</em> local bank accounts.
          </p>

          <p>Now the local banks, using the original $1 billion worth of government checks as "reserves," are permitted
            to inflate our money supply by another $9 billion! (And they accomplish this by making yet more loans of
            money created out of nothing to businesses, individuals, and government.)</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The bottom line is that Congress and the banking cartel have entered into a partnership in which the
              cartel has the privilege of collecting interest on money which it creates out of nothing, a perpetual
              override on every American dollar that exists in the world. Congress, on the other hand, has access to
              unlimited funding without having to tell the voters their taxes are being raised through the process of
              inflation.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Such is the nature of our entire money supply. Our purchasing power is stolen via inflation; our collective
            purchasing power is eroded by inescapable interest on every dollar in existence, and if we (as a nation)
            attempted to pay off any significant portion of our debt (within the rules of the current system), our
            country would be thrust into economic chaos. Why?</p>

          <p>Because just as the "debt dollars" are created out of nothing when a loan is issued, they are "erased" when
            the debt is repaid (and this <em>deflates</em> our money supply).</p>

          <p>As the money supply decreases, those who are trapped in high-dollar loans (like home loans taken out during
            a real estate bubble) will find it increasingly difficult to make their payments. There are simply too few
            dollars to service the debt <em>and</em> fuel the economy.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"
              class="footnote">[3]</a></p>

          <p>It's sobering to consider, under our current system, there can never be another debt-free generation. Not
            even close. To pay off a large portion of our debt would be disastrous; to pay it all off, impossible. Does
            this sound like a system designed with <em>our</em> best interests in mind?</p>

          <h2>The nuts and bolts</h2>

          <p>Alright, we've given the easy explanation; now, a slightly expanded overview of how the Federal Reserve
            System creates and expands our nation's debt money supply. As in the previous example, we'll focus on the
            primary method used; it's called the "open market operation."</p>

          <p><strong>1.</strong> The government needs money, but under our current system, it can't just <em>create
              it</em>. So instead, it creates the next best thing. The government "adds ink to a piece of paper, creates
            impressive designs around the edges, and calls it a [Treasury] bond or Treasury note."<a href="#fn4"
              id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a> These pieces of paper are generically referred to as Treasury
            securities, and they are offered as collateral to potential lenders.</p>

          <p>As a simple example: The government creates a bond in a denomination of $100,000 with a maturity date of 10
            years. All that means is a lender can acquire the bond for $100,000, he will earn interest on the loan for
            10 years, and when the bond matures (at the end of 10 years), his principal loan amount ($100,000) will be
            repaid.</p>

          <p>Treasury securities are offered in many different denominations, and maturity can vary between 30 days (a
            very short-term loan) to 30 years.</p>

          <div class="side-note">
            <p><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> If you or I purchase these Treasury securities, it does not inflate the
              nation's money supply. That is because when you or I loan the government money, we are not allowed to
              create a new pile of money to do it. We must use money we've already earned. The same is true when a
              business or other institution acquires these securities; money already in circulation must be used. Only
              Federal Reserve banks and commercial banks are allowed to create money out of nothing for the purpose of
              lending money to the government.</p>
          </div>

          <p><strong>2.</strong> The government, looking to convert its Treasury securities into something it can spend
            (Federal Reserve Notes and checkbook money), turns to the Fed. The Fed is happy to oblige. It pulls a check
            out of its <em>magic</em> checkbook, writes in whatever dollar amount is needed, and gives it to the
            government in exchange for the securities.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>There is no money in any account to cover this check. Anyone else doing this would be sent to prison. It
              is legal for the Fed, however, because Congress wants the money, and this is the easiest way to get it.
              (To raise taxes would be political suicide; to depend on the public to buy all the bonds would not be
              realistic ... and to print very large quantities of currency would be obvious and controversial.) This
              way, the process is mysteriously wrapped up in the banking system. The end result, however, is the same as
              turning on government printing presses and simply manufacturing fiat money ... to pay government
              expenses.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><strong>3.</strong> The government endorses its Federal Reserve check and then deposits it with one of the
            Federal Reserve banks. The check amount is added to the government's account balance, and just like that,
            the government can begin spending the money, which it does by writing checks of its own.</p>

          <p>"These checks become the means by which the first wave of fiat money floods into the economy. Recipients
            now deposit them into their own [commercial] bank accounts[.]"<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"
              class="footnote">[6]</a> And this is where the <strong><em>real</em> action</strong> begins.</p>

          <div class="side-note">
            <p><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> Some like to point out Federal Reserve banks are "not operated for profit"
              and that they "return to the U.S. Treasury all earnings in excess of Federal Reserve operating expenses."
            </p>

            <p>Assuming we accept <em>all</em> excess earnings really are handed over (the Fed has never been properly
              audited; how could we know?), this fact is still largely irrelevant. Huge profits are made when commercial
              banks get their hands on the newly created Fed money. (This should come as no surprise; it was the
              commercial banking interests of Rockefeller, Morgan, Rothschild, Kuhn Loeb, and Warburg that crafted the
              system.) And if those profits weren't enough, as we've already covered, the <strong>biggest
                <em>profit</em> gained in this game is <em>control</em>.</strong></p>
          </div>

          <p><strong>4.</strong> Assume the government pays Joe Contractor $1 million by check and Joe promptly deposits
            that check at his commercial bank. Joe is happy because his bank account balance is now $1 million bigger.
            But the bank is even happier.</p>

          <p>In accordance with the rules of our Federal Reserve System, commercial banks only need to keep 10% reserves
            on hand. That means the bank Joe deposited his million dollars with now has $900,000 in excess reserves. ($1
            million minus 10% in <em>required reserves</em> leaves $900,000 in excess reserves.) Guess what that means?
            It means the bank is allowed to create $900,000 in <em>new</em> money (for loans) out of thin air.</p>

          <p>But that's not all! When that $900,000 in newly created debt money is spent into the economy, it finds its
            way right back into the banking system as new deposits, and those deposits create excess reserves too.</p>

          <p>So that means a bank can now create $810,000 in new loans out of the $900,000 deposit; again, the debt
            money supply increases! And when that newly created $810,000 is deposited, it can be used to create another
            $729,000.</p>

          <p>This continues over and over again. By the time the process reaches its legal limit, the commercial banks
            will have created nine million new debt dollars on top of the original $1 million Federal Reserve loan (also
            created out of thin air) for the government. (A total increase in our money supply of $10 million!)</p>

          <p>Even if the Fed bank hands over every penny of interest it earns on the $1 million loan to the government,
            the commercial banks can earn 10 times as much (or more depending on the interest rates) on the $9 million
            they created. Now, for a disturbing update, read this footnote: <a href="#fn7" id="fnref7"
              class="footnote">[7]</a></p>

          <p>Try to imagine the wealth and power you could amass under a system that allowed <em>you</em> to do this.
            Imagine being legally allowed to "create" money and then collect interest on it.</p>

          <p>With only $1 billion, you could easily generate $50â€“100 million <em>per year</em> in interest payments.
            Even the best among us, given the chance to acquire such a lucrative, government-backed monopoly, might find
            it hard to resist.</p>

          <p>...To say nothing of a group of unscrupulous, yet highly intelligent, bankers.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The total amount of fiat money created by the Federal Reserve and the commercial banks together is
              approximately ten times the amount of the underlying government debt. To the degree that this newly
              created money floods into the economy in excess of goods and services, it causes the purchasing power of
              all money, both old and new, to decline. Prices go up because the relative value of the money has gone
              down. The result is the same as if that purchasing power had been taken from us in taxes.<a href="#fn8"
                id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

            <p>Since our money supply is purely an arbitrary entity with nothing behind it except debt, its quantity can
              go down as well as up. When people are going deeper into debt, the nation's money supply expands and
              prices go up, but when they pay off their debts and refuse to renew, the money supply contracts and prices
              tumble.</p>

            <p>... This alternation between periods of expansion and contraction of the money supply is the underlying
              cause of ... booms, busts, and depressions.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>

            <p>Who benefits from all of this? Certainly not the average citizen. The only beneficiaries are the
              political scientists in Congress who enjoy the effect of unlimited revenue to perpetuate their power, and
              the monetary scientists within the banking cartel called the Federal Reserve System who have been able to
              harness the American people, without their knowing it, to the yoke of modern feudalism.<a href="#fn10"
                id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>That covers the most common method by which the Fed System inflates our money supply, by "monetizing"
            government debt. (Converting government IOUs like Treasury bonds into "money" by simply creating the money
            out of nothing and <em>loaning</em> it to the government.) The government spends the money, and then
            commercial banks inflate on top of what was originally created. But if the government isn't borrowing enough
            from the Fed, there are plenty of other ways for the system to work its magic.</p>

          <p>Another inflation mechanism is known as the "discount window." The discount window is where commercial
            banks go to borrow money from the Fed. The inflationary process is similar to the open market operation,
            only a little more direct.</p>

          <p>Rather than loan the government money (which then becomes government checks, then eventually becomes
            deposits in commercial banks, then is counted as reserves, which then can be multiplied by up to 10 times
            the original loan amount), the Fed simply loans money to the commercial banks directly. It's a much easier
            process. If a bank borrows $1 million, it can immediately start the process of creating more money.
            (Subtract 10% for reserves; create $900,000. When the $900,000 makes its way back, subtract 10% for
            reserves; create $810,000, etc.)</p>

          <p>The enormous increase in our nation's money supply leading up to the stock market crash in 1929 (and the
            Great Depression) was not due to government borrowing. The government, prior to the crash, was doing well
            and had little need to borrow. No, the bulk of new money originated out of the Fed's discount window. At
            this point in our history, there is little doubt about whether or not Fed policy is what crashed our economy
            and led to the Great Depression. It most certainly did. Today, the arguments should be based on whether or
            not the monetary scientists, working through the Fed, did it on purpose.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11"
              class="footnote">[11]</a></p>

          <p>Another method the Fed can use to increase our money supply is to simply change the required reserve ratios
            that commercial banks must hold. The current requirement of 10% is purely arbitrary. If there is a need for
            more money, it could be easily cut in half to 5% (doubling the amount of new money that can be created from
            deposits), quartered to 2.5%, or even dropped all together. It's the Fed's call.<a href="#fn12"
              id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>

          <p>And as if all this weren't enough, the Monetary Control Act of 1980 handed the Fed even more power. Now,
            the Fed has the authority to legally monetize foreign debt too! (Which it has already done to the tune of
            many billions of dollars.)</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The apparent purpose of this legislation is to ... bailout those governments which are having trouble
              paying the interest on their loans from American banks. When the Fed creates fiat American dollars to give
              foreign governments in exchange for their worthless bonds, the money path is slightly longer and more
              twisted, but the effect is similar to the purchase of U.S. Treasury Bonds.</p>

            <p>... [T]hey flow back into the U.S. money pool (multiplied by nine) in the form of additional loans. The
              cost of the operation is once again borne by the American citizen through the loss of purchasing power.
              ... As long as <em>someone</em> is willing to borrow American dollars, the cartel will have the option of
              creating those dollars specifically to purchase their bonds and, by so doing, continue to expand the money
              supply.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>By confiscating and "redistributing" purchasing power, the elite effectively <em>purchase</em> cooperation.
            It enables them to shape the world as they see fit. (Money is given to those who comply, and it's withheld
            from those who insist on independence.)</p>

          <p>Income tax is one way to confiscate purchasing power, and needless to say, it is a real burden on those who
            actually have to earn their money.</p>

          <p>But inflation is a form of taxation too, and because so few understand it, it is the preferred method for
            shearing the public. Sadly, as the citizens find it harder and harder to get by, they're driven into the
            arms of the very same people who seek to rob and control them.</p>

            <p>[1] "Intrinsic value/physical utility" is often cited as a main characteristic of commodity money.
              However, sticks, stones, feathers and seashells provide other examples. If the commodity is rare, durable,
              difficult to "create," decentralized, and (most importantly) valued by its community, it can serve as
              commodity money. <a href="#fnref1">â†©</a></p>

            <p>[11] Prior to the Great Depression, gold was money in the United States. That ended in 1933 when FDR
              signed executive order 6102, requiring all U.S. citizens to immediately surrender their gold and gold
              certificates to the Federal Reserve. In exchange for their gold, citizens were given "money" that could
              NOT be redeemed in gold (because private gold ownership was now illegal). Failure to comply with the order
              carried a prison sentence of up to 10 years, a $10,000 fine (nearly $250,000 in today's dollars), or both.
