                        <h1>CHAPTER EIGHT<br>False and Designing Men</h1>
                    </div>

                    <p>In the previous chapter, we touched on one of the more devious ways that leaders can manipulate
                        the public: they can choose to implement a <em>dual policy</em> (that is, a policy of publicly
                        <em>pretending</em> to honor the will of the people, while simultaneously doing everything
                        possible to evade it). By any reasonable measure, dual policies constitute an egregious betrayal
                        of democratic principles and public trust. They also reveal the deeply dishonest nature of the
                        ruling class. However, dual policies are <em>not</em> the most effective or the most immoral way
                        to manipulate the public. For that, we must turn to the false-flag operation.</p>

                    <p>The term "false flag" usually describes a deadly or immoral act that is planned and carried out
                        by one group but is made to <em>appear</em> as if it was planned and carried out by another.
                        Adolf Hitler's Operation Himmler provides a good example. It consisted of a series of false-flag
                        operations, each designed to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany. One way
                        the Nazis achieved this was by taking prisoners from concentration camps, dressing them in
                        German uniforms, and then killing them on the Polish frontier.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"
                            class="footnote">[1]</a> These "dead Germans" were later used by Hitler as a justification
                        for attacking Poland in 1939.</p>

                    <p>While false flags are commonly used as a pretext for war, they can also be used by leaders to
                        justify silencing dissent, suspending civil liberties, and seizing additional power. Again, we
                        can turn to Adolf Hitler for an example. Prior to the German election of March 5, 1933, the Nazi
                        Party had done all it could to weaken and disrupt opposing political parties, but despite their
                        best efforts, it appeared as if the Nazis would still face stiff competition at the polls. Here,
                        Quigley describes how they dealt with this problem:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Under circumstances which are still mysterious, a plot was worked out to burn the Reichstag
                            building and blame the Communists…After the building was set on fire…the government at once
                            arrested four Communists, including the party leader in the Reichstag. The day following the
                            fire [Hindenburg, the president of Germany] signed a decree suspending all civil liberties
                            and giving the government power to invade any personal privacy, including the right to
                            search private homes or confiscate property. At once all Communist members of the Reichstag,
                            as well as thousands of others, were arrested…The true story of the Reichstag fire was kept
                            secret only with difficulty. Several persons who knew the truth…were murdered in March and
                            April to prevent their circulating the true story. Most of the Nazis who were in on the plot
                            were murdered by Goring during the "blood purge" of June 30, 1934.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"
                                class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Both Operation Himmler and the plot to burn the Reichstag provide straightforward examples of
                        false-flag operations, but other variations do exist. For instance, sometimes the act of
                        aggression and subsequent casualties are completely fabricated. If you recall from chapter 6,
                        Operation Northwoods offered this type of false flag as one potential option. The proposal
                        involved an elaborate scheme using a remote-controlled drone aircraft and fake cockpit
                        transmissions to make it appear as if Cuba had shot down a US civilian airliner filled with
                        students on vacation. (After being widely reported in the media, this nonevent could have then
                        been used as a pretext for going to war with Cuba.) Northwoods also proposed other common
                        false-flag variations like provoking the enemy and then <em>allowing</em> them to successfully
                        attack (known as a "stand down" false flag) and also <em>creating</em> an enemy, in the form of
                        a terrorist group, and then using the subsequent "terror attacks" as a pretext for going to war.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although Operation Northwoods was endorsed by the highest-ranking officer in the US armed forces
                        (chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lyman Lemnitzer) and although it went all the way to
                        President Kennedy's desk for final approval, some insist that it was just a one-time aberration
                        that had no chance of ever going operational. Those who make this claim are not serious students
                        of Network-directed policy. Nonetheless, it's worth looking at the primary argument they offer
                        in defense of their position, which is that Lemnitzer allegedly lost his job for signing off on
                        the plan. (I suspect that you or I would face something a little more severe than unemployment
                        if we conspired to facilitate terror attacks against US targets, but I digress.)</p>

                    <p>It is true that Lemnitzer, after signing off on Northwoods, was denied another term as chairman
                        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but he wasn't jobless for very long. Rather, he was soon appointed
                        Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, and NATO is the organization that, along with the CIA, created
                        and ran Operation Gladio. In other words, Lemnitzer's new post provided him the perfect lawless
                        environment to operate in—where orchestrating violent government coups, engaging in false-flag
                        terrorism, and carrying out assassinations all served to further official Network policy. He
                        wasn't <em>punished</em>; he was promoted.</p>

                    <h2>Operation Gladio</h2>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people
                            far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple…to force these people…to
                            turn to the State to ask for greater security. This is the political logic that lies behind
                            all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished, because the State cannot convict
                            itself or declare itself responsible for what happened."</p>
                        <p class="quote-attribution">—Vincenzo Vinciguerra, Gladio-linked terrorist<a href="#fn3"
                                id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>If Operation Gladio had been conceived and directed by the Nazis, most people would have no
                        problem believing every despicable detail. Why? Because most people accept that the Nazis were
                        psychotic criminals who engaged in countless violations of human rights and that they had no
                        respect for freedom or "democracy." Learning of additional crimes wouldn't disrupt the average
                        person's world view at all…far from it. Confirmation bias<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"
                            class="footnote">[4]</a> would kick in, and the individual would experience the
                        psychological rewards of having their world view confirmed.</p>

                    <p>But what happens when, instead of the Nazis, it's the United States Government that is accused of
                        countless violations of human rights? What happens when the presumed <em>guardian</em> of
                        freedom and democracy is accused of using terrorism and murder to circumvent both? Now,
                        confirmation bias begins working in reverse. The individual's deeply held beliefs about
                        America's morality are challenged. There are no psychological rewards for even considering the
                        charges, let alone accepting them. Faced with this threat to their world view, many will
                        immediately reject the accusations as ridiculous. They will angrily defend the good name of
                        America and shower the accuser in hatred and condemnation.</p>

                    <p>The Network knows this. Countless university studies (along with secret operations like MK Ultra)
                        have provided their experts an understanding of human psychology that exceeds anything we can
                        comfortably imagine. They are masters at manipulating the well-meaning public away from
                        scrutinizing their crimes. But there is a key to understanding this particular manipulation; its
                        success relies almost entirely on how the accusation is <em>framed</em>. (In this case the more
                        sweeping the accusation, the better it is for the Network.)</p>

                    <p>In other words, it actually <em>is</em> ridiculous to accuse the United States government of
                        facilitating terror attacks when 99.9 percent of the government's employees had no idea what was
                        going on and had no say in the matter. It <em>is</em> ridiculous to accuse "America" of
                        supporting ruthless dictators and working to <em>destroy</em> freedom around the world when none
                        of the American public was ever asked its opinion on the <em>policy</em>.</p>

                    <p>Though stated in earlier chapters, this point deserves further clarification before we continue:
                        the average government employee, the average American citizen, and the nation as a whole has
                        nothing to do with operations like Gladio. These operations are created and run by the Network,
                        and the Network is composed of criminals in the truest sense of the word. These criminals do not
                        respect "America" or the American form of government. Quite the contrary, they despise it. If
                        permitted to do so, they <em>will</em> destroy the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, because
                        the ideals enshrined in these documents are nothing more than a limitation on their power. They
                        <em>do not</em> represent the United States or its people.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"
                            class="footnote">[5]</a></p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, it makes no difference whether or not <em>the people</em> agree with the Network's
                        policies at this point. Under the current system, public opinion is skillfully manipulated or
                        outright ignored. This is the heart of our problem, and it leads us to a troubling question from
                        Daniele Ganser's book on Operation Gladio:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>If democracy is a system of rules and procedures which define the parameters within which
                            political action can take place, what happens when alongside this system there is another
                            [system] whose rules are mysterious, its procedures unknown, its power immense and which is
                            able to protect itself against the formal institutions of democracy by a wall of secrecy?<a
                                href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>That's a pretty easy question to answer. The <em>hidden</em> system is where the real power
                        resides. The visible system is only there to maintain the illusion of legitimate government and
                        conceal the hand of those who've taken hold. So let's reveal that hand now.</p>

                    <p>The CIA created Gladio, in cooperation with British intelligence (MI6), under the pretext of
                        containing the Communist threat. (Even this seemingly valid pretext was a deception, because the
                        Network had been instrumental in <em>creating</em> and sustaining the Communist threat all
                        along,<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a> with even deadlier consequences than
                        the Hitler-empowerment project.) Gladio's network of secret armies engaged in "unorthodox
                        warfare" under NATO command. They operated not only in all sixteen NATO countries during the
                        Cold War, but also within the neutral countries of Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Switzerland.<a
                            href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a> The existence of these armies was kept
                        hidden from all but a handful of government personnel within each country. Ganser writes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The secret armies were equipped by the CIA and the MI6 with machine guns, explosives,
                            munitions and high-tech communication equipment…Leading officers of the secret network
                            trained together with US Green Berets…and the British SAS Special Forces…The secret armies,
                            as the secondary sources now available suggest, were involved in a whole series of terrorist
                            operations and human rights violations that they wrongly blamed on the Communists in order
                            to discredit the left at the polls. The operations always aimed at spreading maximum fear
                            among the population and ranged from bomb massacres in trains and market squares (Italy),

                    <p>Though these secret armies were allegedly created to protect the Western European democracies
                        from Soviet invasion, they were instead used to interfere with the democratic process whenever
                        the electorate threatened to vote contrary to the Network's desires. This dual policy (claiming
                        to protect national sovereignty and democracy, while simultaneously working to undermine it) was
                        apparently outlined in a secret NATO document dating back to 1949. The document stated that
                        before a nation could join NATO, it had to agree to remain aligned with the "West"
                        <em>regardless</em> of what the electorate of the nation wanted.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10"

                        within a nation became so fed up with their puppet NATO leadership that they rose up against it,
                        the US military would come in and suppress the uprising, even if that meant acting
                        <em>without</em> the consent of the national government itself.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11"

                    <p>There are many very disturbing things about Operation Gladio, but perhaps the most disturbing is
                        that the CIA and NATO managed to keep it secret for so long. Despite a long list of murders and
                        atrocities committed by the armies, and by ruthless regimes that the armies supported, both the
                        operation and its architects remained hidden for more than forty years. It wasn't until 1990
                        that the first on-the-record government disclosure was made, and not because of a desire to come
                        clean, but because former denials could no longer stand.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12"
                            class="footnote">[12]</a> If not for the efforts of an inquisitive Italian judge named
                        Felice Casson, Gladio might never have been exposed.</p>

                    <h2>Uncovering Gladio</h2>

                    <p>In 1984 Judge Felice Casson began digging into an unsolved crime: a car-bomb attack that took
                        place near Peteano, Italy, in 1972. Though the attack killed three police officers and seriously
                        wounded another, the Italian government never managed to find and prosecute the terrorists
                        involved. While conducting his research, Casson discovered a series of suspicious "blunders and
                        fabrications" that had derailed the original investigation. One of those fabrications included a
                        deliberately falsified report about the type of explosive used in the attack. This specific
                        piece of evidence not only led Casson to the man who had planted the bomb, it also led him to
                        the reason <em>why</em> the terrorist had escaped punishment for more than a decade.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Judge Casson…discovered that the report which at the time claimed that the explosive used in
                            Peteano had been the one traditionally used by the [Communist] Red Brigades was a forgery.
                            Marco Morin, an expert for explosives of the Italian police, had deliberately provided fake
                            expertise. He was a member of the Italian right-wing organization "Ordine Nuovo" [New Order]
                            and within the Cold War context contributed his part to what he thought was a legitimate way
                            of combating the influence of the Italian Communists. Judge Casson was able to prove that
                            the explosive used in Peteano contrary to Morin's expertise was C4, the most powerful
                            explosive available at the time, used also by NATO.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13"
                                class="footnote">[13]</a></p>

                        <p>Casson's investigation revealed that…Ordine Nuovo had collaborated very closely with the
                            Italian Military Secret Service…Together <strong>they had engineered the Peteano
                                terror</strong> and then wrongly blamed [the Communist] Red Brigades. Judge Casson
                            identified Ordine Nuovo member Vincenzo Vinciguerra as the man who had planted the Peteano
                            bomb…He confessed and testified that he had been covered by an entire network of
                            sympathizers in Italy and abroad who had ensured that after the attack he could escape. "A
                            whole mechanism came into action," Vinciguerra recalled, "[the Italian military police] the
                            Minister of the Interior, the customs services and the military and civilian intelligence
                            services accepted the ideological reasoning behind the attack."<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14"

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Out of Casson's investigation, and the successful prosecution of Vinciguerra that followed, the
                        Gladio secret finally began to unravel. Unpunished attacks that had terrorized Italian citizens
                        through the 1970s and 1980s were now examined in a new light. The Piazza Fontana massacre of
                        1969, the 1974 "Italicus Express" attack, the 1980 Bologna railway bomb that killed eighty-five
                        and maimed two hundred: all of these served to further the aims outlined by Vincent Vinciguerra
                        during his sworn testimony in 1984. Keep in mind, Vinciguerra provided his testimony six years
                        <em>before</em> the Italian government admitted that the secret armies existed. He described
                        Gladio, including its link to the Italian secret service and NATO, in unequivocal terms:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>With the massacre of Peteano, and with all those that have followed, the knowledge should by
                            now be clear that there existed a real live structure, occult and hidden, with the capacity
                            of giving a strategic direction to the outrages…[it] lies within the state itself…There
                            exists in Italy a secret force parallel to the armed forces, composed of civilians and
                            military men, in an anti-Soviet capacity…A secret organization, a super-organization with a
                            network of communications, arms and explosives, and men trained to use them…A
                            super-organization which…took up the task, on Nato's behalf, of preventing a slip to the
                            left in the political balance of the country.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15"

                    <p>In another statement Vinciguerra stated:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The terrorist line was followed by camouflaged people, people belonging to the security
                            apparatus, or those linked to the state apparatus through rapport or collaboration. I say
                            that every single outrage that followed from 1969 fitted into a single, organized
                            matrix…Avanguardia Nazionale, like Ordine Nuovo…were being mobilized into the battle as part
                            of an anti-communist strategy <strong>originating not with organizations deviant from the
                                institutions of power, but from within the state itself, and specifically from within
                                the ambit of the state's relations within the [NATO] Atlantic Alliance</strong>.<a

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Although Vinciguerra wasn't the first person to expose Gladio under oath (the former head of the
                        Italian secret service had resentfully confessed ten years earlier<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17"
                            class="footnote">[17]</a>), his testimony and Casson's further research is what finally
                        broke the story. It forced the Italian prime minister to retract his earlier denials and
                        publicly admit the existence of Gladio to the amazement of citizens and parliamentarians alike.
                    </p>

                    <p>This watershed moment not only exposed the Network's secret armies in Italy, but it led to the
                        discovery of secret armies in nineteen other countries as well. From the torture and terror in
                        Francisco Franco's Spain (where a former defense minister admitted "here Gladio was the
                        government"<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a>), to the assassinations and
                        false flags carried out in Turkey; from the indiscriminant mass shootings of men, women, and
                        children in Belgium,<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a> to the imposition of
                        a military dictatorship in Greece, the Network ruthlessly violated the sovereignty of nations
                        while claiming to defend freedom, human rights, and democracy. For insight into the level of
                        hypocrisy, consider this snapshot of what occurred in Greece immediately following the "Gladio
                        coup."</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In the space of some five hours, over 10,000 people were arrested by military squads
                            according to detailed files and planning, and were taken to "reception centers"…Most of
                            those who were arrested in the first hours after the coup were later moved to police and
                            army cells. Communists, Socialists, artists, academics, journalists, students, politically
                            active women, priests, including their friends and families, were tortured. Their toe and
                            fingernails were torn out. Their feet were beaten with sticks until the skin came off and
                            bones were broken…Filthy rags, often soaked in urine, and sometimes excrement, were pushed
                            down their throats…"We are all democrats here"…the chief of the secret police in Athens was
                            fond of stressing. "Everybody who comes here talks. You're not spoiling our record." The
                            sadist torturer made it clear to his victims: "We are the government, you are nothing…The
                            whole world is in two parts, the Russians and the Americans. We are the Americans. Be

                        <p>It would be bad enough if the Network limited its policy of employing terrorists and propping
                            up ruthless dictators to just Western Europe. But that, of course, would be ridiculous. The
                            Shah in Iran, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, the military junta in Argentina—each of these
                            regimes brutalized their citizens with torture and murder; each of these regimes was brought
                            to power by the Network. Worse still, they represent only a few of the <em>proven</em>
                            "regime change actions"<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote">[21]</a> conducted by

                    <p>These acts of aggression against national sovereignty send a crystal-clear message to any
                        leadership that dares to disobey: resist, and the consequences for you <em>and the people of
                            your country</em> could be very dire. Here again the Gladio coup in Greece provides some
                        insight. In 1964 (prior to the coup), the Greek ambassador had rejected Network demands to
                        divide the island nation of Cyprus. Infuriated, President Lyndon Johnson warned: <strong>"Then
                            listen to me, Mr. Ambassador, fuck your parliament and your constitution. America is an
                            elephant. Cyprus is a flea. Greece is a flea…If your Prime Minister gives me talk about
                            democracy, parliament and constitution, he, his parliament and his constitution may not last
                            very long."</strong><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote">[22]</a> In 1967, after
                        some additional "disagreements" with the Network, Greek Gladio carried out Johnson's threat.<a

                    <p>Although Operation Gladio was exposed more than twenty years ago, <em>most</em> public officials
                        still aren't ready to admit that the Gladio armies facilitated coups, carried out terrorist
                        attacks, or sought to provide "a strategic direction to the outrages." To be fair, there isn't
                        much of an incentive for them to do so. Since we still live in a Network-dominated world, such
                        unflattering statements could bring a wide range of consequences—everything from a ruined
                        career, to torture, to a bullet in the head.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24"
                            class="footnote">[24]</a> However, that's not to say that all public officials have turned
                        their backs on the evidence and remained silent. One of the more-damning indictments came from
                        an Italian investigation in 2000:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>A 2000 Senate report, stated that "Those massacres, those bombs, those military actions had
                            been organized or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions and, as has
                            been discovered more recently, by men linked to the structures of United States
                            intelligence." According to <em>The Guardian</em>, "The report [claimed] that US
                            intelligence agents were informed in advance about several rightwing terrorist bombings…but
                            did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place."<a

                    <p>In 1990, the European Union (EU) parliament "sharply condemned NATO and the United States in a
                        resolution for having manipulated European politics with the stay-behind armies."<a href="#fn26"
                            id="fnref26" class="footnote">[26]</a> The parliament called for a full investigation, but
                        the political will to get this done (or maybe the political <em>power</em> to get this done) has
                        yet to materialize. Sadly, the EU parliament isn't alone in its lack of resolve. Out of the
                        twenty countries affected by Gladio, only three (Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium) have bothered
                        to conduct a parliamentary investigation.</p>

                    <p>During the Swiss investigation, Colonel Herbert Alboth (former commander of P-26, the Swiss
                        secret army) sent a confidential letter to a member of the defense department declaring that he
                        was willing to reveal the "whole truth." Soon thereafter, Alboth was found stabbed to death with
                        his own military bayonet.<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote">[27]</a> The
                        investigation continued but only yielded a heavily redacted report that said, in part, that the
                        secret army was without "political or legal legitimacy," and that it worked closely with the
                        British secret service who provided "training in combat, communications, and sabotage."<a
                            href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote">[28]</a> This fell far short of what might have
                        come to light if not for Alboth's death and its predictable chilling effect on witnesses and
                        parliamentarians.</p>

                    <p>The Belgian inquiry yielded even less information. Hamstrung from the start by the unwillingness
                        of witnesses to disclose what they knew and made worse by the government's insistence that the
                        commission operate behind closed doors (unlike normal parliamentary inquiries), public and press
                        access to information proved insignificant. In the end, the inquiry "resulted in the preparation
                        of new legislation governing the mission and methods of the Belgian State Security Service and
                        Belgian General Information and Security Service."<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29"
                            class="footnote">[29]</a> For lack of a better word, it amounted to a whitewash.</p>

                    <p>Maybe Switzerland and Belgium are "fleas." Maybe the EU and all of the other nations affected by
                        Gladio are fleas. Maybe these European leaders are so afraid of the Network's "elephant" that
                        they cannot effectively do their job. Ah, but we can't just blame the European leaders for
                        <em>their</em> lack of courage. How many US leaders have called for an investigation into
                        Gladio? (Have you ever even heard the word "Gladio" leave the lips of <em>any</em> US

                    <p>It's likely that less than 1 percent of the US population has heard of Operation Gladio. Even
                        fewer could explain its undeniably antidemocratic and illegal influence on sovereignty. But
                        since the Network is strongest in the United States, a total lack of mainstream coverage and
                        knowledge is predictable. The media, the public schools, the government: all of these
                        instruments constantly profess the sanctity of justice, freedom, and democracy. If US citizens
                        were to get a good look at what their rulers will do to maintain control overseas, they might
                        just start looking into what they will do to maintain control at home. They might just ask
                        themselves: If these criminals will lie, cheat, steal, torture, maim, and murder to control
                        "fleas," what will they do to maintain control of their elephant, their most cherished and
                        powerful instrument?</p>

                        <p>As early as 1991, the US National Security Archive at George Washington University filed a
                            Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request regarding the CIA's role in Operation Gladio. In
                            1995, the Italian senate filed a FOIA request regarding Operation Gladio and the
                            assassination of Prime Minister Aldo Moro. In 1996, Oliver Rathkolb of Vienna University
                            filed a FOIA request regarding Gladio's role in Austria. In 2001 (and beyond), Daniele
                            Ganser has filed FOIA requests regarding the CIA's role in Gladio. In each instance, the CIA
                            has rejected the requests with the standard reply of "The CIA can neither confirm nor deny
                            the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to your request."</p>

                                Secret Armies</em> by challenging the authenticity of <em>one</em> very damning document
                            he presents in the book. That document, FM 30-31B, is similar to Operation Northwoods in its
                            shocking content but worse because the false-flag operations described were actually carried
                            out by members of the secret armies. The document was first discovered by a journalist in
                            Turkey seventeen years <em>prior to</em> the public admission of Gladio. (That journalist
                            was disappeared before he could provide additional details.) In 1976, after the fall of the
                            Franco/Gladio dictatorship in Spain, excerpts of the document were published in the Spanish
                            press, and in 1978 excerpts were also published in Italy.<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31"

                            Operation Gladio in Europe led to renewed debate as to whether or not the manual was

                        <p>[7] From the IPR's role in Communist China to the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of the
                            Soviet Union, the "capitalist" Network provided indispensable assistance including financial
                            aid and military technology to their so-called "enemies" in the East. Professor Antony
                            Sutton authored many books documenting the Network's role in the rise of Communism
                            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_C._Sutton). After decades of research, he eventually
                            declared the Communists "the best enemy money can buy" and he was right. Without the threat
                            of Communism, there would have been no justification for the unprecedented expansion of US
                            military spending and the equally unprecedented acceptance of foreign interventionism.
                            (Today, terrorism has replaced Communism as the Network's go-to pretext.) <a

                            secret service (Vito Miceli) on the charge of "promoting, setting up, and organizing…a
                            secret association of military and civilians aimed at [bringing] about an illegal change in
                            the constitution of the state and the form of government." While on trial, Miceli confessed
                            to setting up the secret army, but furiously replied that it was done under the direction of
                            the United States and NATO. Due to his powerful contacts, Miceli was released on bail and
                            eventually served six months in an Italian military hospital. Reference: <em>NATO's Secret

                            "Counter-Guerrilla" (the Turkish Gladio army). Shortly after its publication, he was
                            tortured and shot in the back of the head (reference pages 240 and 241 of <em>NATO's Secret
