          </blockquote>

          <p>If you were alive in 1910, you wouldn't have been invited to the meeting. Don't feel bad. Only a handful of
            the world's 1.7 billion inhabitants at the time were important enough (and powerful enough) to be summoned.
          </p>

          <p>You also wouldn't have known anything about what was discussed. In fact, you would have never known that a
            meeting took place. Despite the enormous impact on your country's future, the scheme to create a new
            "monetary system" was none of your business. As such, the powerful men who organized the meeting went to
            great lengths to keep it a secret.</p>

          <p>What you <em>would have</em> known in 1910 is the names of the powerful men who organized the meeting. They
            were Rockefeller, Rothschild, Morgan, and Warburg. Through their banks and investment firms, these four
            names represented 25% of the world's wealth. And in those days, the <em>common people</em> kept a close eye
            on these super-rich bankers.</p>

          <p>Citizens in the United States and Europe knew the game. They knew how the financial elite used their power
            to dominate industries and influence government. If word had gotten out that these extremely powerful
            competitors were meeting secretly, people would have feared they were combining forces to gain even more
            power and control. (The people would have been right.)</p>

          <p>So, this is where the story of the Federal Reserve System begins. The banking empires of Rockefeller,
            Rothschild, Morgan, and Warburg arranged a top-secret meeting and sent representatives on their behalf to
            the privately owned Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia.</p>

          <p>To prevent the men from being recognized, Jekyll Island's permanent staff were sent on vacation, and
            carefully screened temps took their place. Each representative was sworn to secrecy and instructed to only
            use their first name to further conceal their identity. (Nearly two decades passed before any of them
            publicly admitted they'd participated in the meeting.)</p>

          <p>In that meeting, the financial elite created, for themselves, the monetary system that we live under today.
          </p>

          <h2>Those involved<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a></h2>

          <ol>
            <li>U.S. Senator, chairman of the National Monetary Commission, J.P. Morgan business associate, and
              father-in-law to John D. Rockefeller Jr.: Nelson W. Aldrich</li>
            <li>Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury: Abraham Piatt Andrew</li>
            <li>The head of J.P. Morgan's Bankers Trust Company: Benjamin Strong</li>
            <li>Senior partner of the J.P. Morgan Company: Henry P. Davison</li>
            <li>Representing William Rockefeller and the international investment banking house of Kuhn, Loeb and
              Company and president of the National City Bank of New York (The most powerful bank at the time): Frank A.
              Vanderlip</li>
            <li>Representing the Rothschild banking dynasty in England and France, partner in Kuhn, Loeb and Company,
              brother of Max Warburg, who was head of the Warburg banking consortium in Germany and the Netherlands:
              Paul M. Warburg</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Powerful competitors joining forces to achieve a common goal is nothing new. What is new about this
            particular meeting is the sheer magnitude of its success. By first writing the laws that would govern their
            industry, and then using government to pass and enforce those laws, the men of Jekyll Island created a
            system of generating profit and control that is unrivaled in all of human history.</p>

          <p>By setting their differences aside, they could now direct their combined power against anything that stood
            in their way. Common enemies, like emerging competition, currency drains, and bank runs, were targeted
            first. These enemies limited the expansion of their wealth and power. Now they could be dealt with.</p>

          <h2>Emerging competition</h2>

          <p>From the years 1900 to 1910, the number of banks operating in the United States more than doubled to over
            20,000.</p>

          <p>Most of the new banks had sprung up in the South and West, and this was costing the large New York banks an
            increasing percentage of their business. However, in a free market economy, there was little the New York
            bankers could do (legally) to stop this. So, as is often the case with unimaginably rich and powerful
            people, they co-opted the power of government. By rewriting the rules and regulations in their favor, they
            could systematically weaken and eliminate their competitors.</p>

          <p>Another form of unwanted competition came from self-financing. That is to say, businesses were using their
            own profits to finance new projects instead of using bank-borrowed funds. From 1900 to 1910, 70% of funding
            for corporate growth came from within.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>

          <p>As such, the banks were being cut out of the equation, and businesses were becoming increasingly
            independent. Even the federal government had gotten into the act. Worse than "not borrowing," the government
            was actually paying off the national debt. Less and less debt equals less and less profit for the banks.
            This was a trend that had to stop.</p>

          <p>To gain control of the problem, the bankers needed a system that allowed them to bypass the free market and
            manipulate interest rates directly. For instance, to encourage debt over saving and self-financing, they
            could tip the interest rates down. (Low interest rates encourage people to borrow and spend recklessly. More
            borrowing equals more debt; more debt equals more profit and power for the banks.) Then there is the option
            of being able to raise interest rates at will — even more profit and power in the palm of their hands.</p>

          <h2>Bank runs</h2>

          <p>One of the greatest threats a bank faces is known as a "bank run." It should be noted that if banks
            actually ran a legitimate business, bank runs wouldn't be a problem. But they don't run a legitimate
            business, and so bank runs are a problem. To understand what a bank run is, it helps to understand the
            fraudulent nature of our banking system. In essence, it is this:</p>

          <p>When you deposit money in a bank, you expect the bank to keep your money safe until you want to withdraw
            it. If 100 people deposit $100 in a bank ($10,000 total), the expectation is the bank now has $10,000 in
            their vault. Under these circumstances, there would be no problem if all 100 people showed up on the same
            day to withdraw their $100. The bank could simply take the $10,000 out of the vault, return $100 to 100
            people, and that would be the end of that.</p>

          <p>The problem is the bank never has anywhere near as much money on hand as it owes to its depositors. Instead
            of keeping your money in their vault, the bank loans it out to others. As if that isn't bad enough, based on
            the rules of our current system, they are then allowed to loan out even more money they don't physically
            have. (Don't worry, we'll cover this ridiculous fact of modern banking in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.) When all is
            said and done, it isn't uncommon for a bank to have only a couple dollars on hand for every $100 or more
            that it owes to others.</p>

          <p>If the public keeps its money in the bank, as it usually does, no problems arise. But if something spooks
            the public, or if more than a few percent of the population simply decide they'd like to have their money,
            the scam is exposed. When word gets out that the bank is stalling or unable to pay its depositors, the
            problem intensifies. Suddenly, masses of people converge on the bank in an attempt to withdraw their money.
            This is known as a bank run. The bank, of course, doesn't have anywhere near enough money to honor the
            withdrawal requests, and bankruptcy usually follows. Sadly, the depositors end up paying the price.</p>

          <p>A normal human would look at the system and say it needs to be corrected. Banks shouldn't be allowed to
            loan out a depositor's money without the depositor's consent. Nor should the bank be permitted to create
            even <em>greater</em> financial obligations by loaning out even more money it doesn't actually have. But who
            said any of this was going to make sense?</p>

          <p>We can't forget the banking business is a <em>business.</em> Its current structure wasn't created for the
            benefit of the normal humans who don't understand it. There is a lot of profit to be made in loaning out
            money you didn't have to earn, so figuring out a way to protect the inherently fraudulent system (rather
            than correcting it) was one of the main goals of the Jekyll Island conspirators.</p>

          <h2>Currency Drains (important note on usage<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a>)</h2>

          <p>A currency drain is very similar to a bank run. The bank owes more money to other people than it has on
            hand, and as a result, it is driven into bankruptcy. With a currency drain, however, instead of
            <em>depositors</em> lining up at the bank's teller window seeking their money, now it is other
            <em>banks</em> lining up seeking what they're owed.
          </p>

          <p>As an easy example, imagine for a moment there are only two banks: Joe's Bank and Mary's Bank.</p>

          <p>Let's say that I (Joe) have a $100 balance in my checking account. I decide I want to purchase Mary's
            computer, and she agrees to sell it to me for $100. Rather than go to my bank to withdraw cash, I simply
            write Mary a check.</p>

          <p>When Mary cashes my check at her bank, the $100 she is given comes out of <em>her bank's</em> available
            cash. In other words, Mary's bank is temporarily "down" $100. Therefore, the transaction isn't complete
            until Mary's bank sends my check back to my bank and receives $100 in return.</p>

          <p>Now imagine my bank agrees to loan me $1,000 it does not have. (Again, we'll cover how banks literally
            "create money out of nothing" in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.) For now, suffice to say my bank simply types "1,000"
            into their computer and, by doing so, adds $1,000 to my checking account balance.</p>

          <p>With my new $1,000 balance, I go to Mary and ask if she'd like to sell her old lawn tractor. She agrees. I
            write her a check for $1,000, she deposits it in her bank, and her bank returns the check to my bank for
            payment. However, this time my bank cannot come up with the cash it needs to pay Mary's bank. This is the
            basic idea of how a "currency drain" manifests. Currency drains come about when banks make more promises to
            pay money on demand than they can keep.</p>

          <p>Of course, in the real world, there are many banks and many customers. While I'm writing a check for $1,000
            that will be deposited in Mary's bank, somebody from Mary's bank might write a check for $1,000 that will be
            deposited in mine. In this case, the two checks would cancel each other out (each bank owes the other
            $1,000). Because no money needs to be transferred to balance these transactions, there wouldn't be any drain
            on either bank's available currency.</p>

          <p>Another scenario where a bank would not have to worry about experiencing a currency drain would be: I write
            a check from my bank to somebody who also banks at my bank (or one of my bank's many other branches). When
            the person I wrote my check to deposits it at one of the other "Joe's bank" branches, the bank only needs to
            subtract some digits from my account balance and add some to the depositor's account.</p>

          <p>But back to the main point: Rigging the system to protect against currency drains (rather than correcting
            the underlying fraud that causes them) was one of the <em>great achievements</em> of those who brought us
            our Federal Reserve System.</p>

          <h2>Banker's heaven</h2>

          <p>As the system stood in 1910, some banks were more reckless than others about loaning money they didn't
            have. Remember, banks make money on loans. The more loans they can issue and collect interest on, the more
            profit they earn. There is always a great temptation to loan as much as possible.</p>

          <p>The predictable result of reckless banking was this: Customers would borrow from a reckless bank and then
            write checks on their newly created account balance. Those checks would wind up deposited with other banks
            and those other banks would demand payment. Inevitably, the reckless bank would be drained of all its
            available currency (all of its customers' cash deposits) and would go belly up.</p>

          <p>To illustrate this a little further, imagine we have a cautious bank and a reckless bank. The cautious bank
            has $10,000 of its own money on hand for every $10,000 in checking account money it creates as loans. As a
            result of keeping cash reserves equal to 100% of its loans, it will never have a problem with too many
            checks coming in from other banks. It will always be able to meet its obligation to produce cash because its
            obligations are 100% backed by its cash reserves.</p>

          <p>Our other bank (the reckless one) has $10,000 in cash on hand, but it isn't happy with earning interest on
            only $10,000 in loans. It wants to earn interest on $500,000. So, it starts issuing loans (creating new
            checking account balances "out of thin air" for its loan customers). As those customers start writing
            checks, and those checks start finding their way into other banks, the inevitable currency drain begins. The
            bank goes broke, depositors lose everything, and the <em>free money</em> (interest/profit earned on money
            that existed only as keystrokes in a computer) is over for the bankers involved.</p>

          <p>Historian John Klein explains: "The financial panics of 1873, 1884, 1893, and 1907 were in large part ...
            triggered by the currency drains that took place in periods of relative prosperity when banks were loaned
            up."<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>

          <p>In other words, banks were walking closer and closer to the edge of how much money they could loan out
            (without sufficient cash to back those loans), and this practice led to repeated panics and the failure of
            some 1,748 banks over a couple decades. Again, rather than do the obvious (fix the fraudulent system), our
            banker friends were intent on expanding their profits and protecting themselves from the naturally occurring
            losses.</p>

          <h2>The Jekyll Island Bankers' immediate wish list probably looked something like this:</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Stop the growing influence of smaller rival banks. By pushing them out, they could expand their control
              over the nation's financial resources.</li>
            <li>Make the money supply "more elastic." (Make it easier for them to create large amounts of money out of
              thin air to loan.)</li>
            <li>Create a system that would allow them to manipulate interest rates. (With this power, they could entice
              borrowers and reverse the trend of people using their own profits to finance growth.)</li>
            <li>To help stave off currency drains and bank runs, encourage banks to maintain the same loan to reserve
              ratio (If everyone "only" loans out <em>ten times</em> their cash reserves, the system would be easier to
              manage than if some banks were "recklessly" loaning out 50 or 100 times their reserves.)</li>
            <li>Consolidate the inadequate cash reserves of the nation's individual banks into one large reserve. (That
              way, if a member bank was experiencing a run, cash from the consolidated reserve could be sent over to
              satisfy withdrawal requests.)</li>
            <li>If the entire system should come crashing down, have a mechanism in place to shift the losses from the
              bankers to the taxpayers.</li>
            <li>Convince the people and Congress that the new system was meant to protect and benefit the public.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>To achieve all of these ambitious goals, the bankers needed a strong alliance backed with legislation and
            sustained by the power of government. A near perfect model was already up and running in Europe; it was
            simply a matter of exporting it to the United States.</p>

          <p>Still, that would prove easier said than done. Unlike today, voters knew better than to allow a handful of
            bankers to centralize power, interfere with competition, and manipulate the free-market system.</p>

          <p>People had no faith in what was commonly referred to as "the money trust," and the men conspiring to create
            the new system <em>were literally</em> the money trust. So, selling the scheme became an issue of wrapping
            everything in the right words and then pouring on the propaganda.</p>

          <h2>How they sold it to the public</h2>

          <p>Anger over recent panics and bank failures (caused by the fraudulent banking system already in place) was
            used to stir up demands for monetary reform. After creating sufficient public outcry, the Jekyll Island
            conspirators stood ready with the solution they had drafted.</p>

          <p>The cartel<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a> would operate as a central bank, but for
            the purpose of public relations the word "bank" would not be used. To gain the public's trust, the new
            system was given the appearance of a federal agency. (In reality, the system was created and is controlled
            by private interests.)<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a></p>

          <p>The plan's initial structure was kept somewhat conservative, but it contained plenty of wiggle room to get
            it just right over time. To avoid the appearance of a "Wall Street centralized power structure," it was
            designed with regional branches scattered about the country. To create the appearance of academic approval,
            university professors were employed to tout its merits.</p>

          <p>Last but not least, the same men who conspired to make the plan a reality attacked and condemned it
            publicly. This final step convinced the public it was "bad for the money trust" and hence "good for them."
            From start to finish, the banker's PsyOP<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a> worked like a
            charm.</p>

          <p>What began as a secret plan in 1910 became a reality on December 23, 1913. The Creature from Jekyll Island
            (The Federal Reserve System) was signed into existence, and it has been feeding on us all ever since.</p>

          <p>Although The Fed was supposedly implemented to stabilize our economy and benefit the public, a look at its
            history shows it has done anything but.</p>

            <p>Since its inception, it has presided over the crashes of 1921 and 1929; the Great Depression of '29 --
              '39; recessions in '53, '57, '69, '75, and '81; a stock market "Black Monday" in '87; and a 1000%
              inflation which has destroyed 90% of the dollar's purchasing power.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9"
                class="footnote">[9]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>That latter point (a 1000% inflation which has destroyed 90% of the dollar's purchasing power) is an
            outdated figure. As of this writing, it is actually closer to a <strong>97%</strong> loss in purchasing
            power! It's impossible to assess the full impact of the Federal Reserve System without taking this into
            account.</p>

          <p>Inflation has been called a "hidden tax" because it reduces your purchasing power just as surely as
            government taking part of what you've earned (in taxes) reduces your purchasing power.</p>

          <p>If you earn $10,000 and the government takes $3,000 of it, your purchasing power has been reduced by 30%.
            If you earn $10,000 and a government-sanctioned inflationary policy reduces the purchasing power of your
            money by 30%, the impact on your earnings is the same; you've suffered a loss in purchasing power equal to
            $3,000.</p>

          <p>It's no different than if they had simply taken the $3,000 from you. Unfortunately, very few people
            understand this, and that works to the advantage of those who are doing the taking.</p>

          <p>Think about it. You'd be mad if a thief stole $3,000 from you. You'd know exactly how much of your money
            was stolen, and you'd want to go after the person who took it. But when was the last time you complained
            about the erosion of your purchasing power? When was the last time you tried to figure out how much of your
            money has been stolen via inflation over the past five or 10 years? When was the last time you went after
            those responsible?</p>

          <p>We will cover inflation in greater detail in upcoming chapters. For now, we'll keep it very simple: As the
            Federal Reserve facilitates the reckless expansion of our money supply (inflating the amount of currency and
            credit in our economy), the ever-increasing volume of money decreases the value of our dollars. As the value
            of our dollars goes down, the number of dollars it takes to buy things goes up.</p>

          <p>In short, the Federal Reserve System has failed miserably in its stated objectives. It has not stabilized
            the economy, and it does not protect and benefit the public. Furthermore, based on the inherently fraudulent
            nature of the system, it can be reasonably argued that its stated objectives were never its real objectives
            at all.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>When one realizes the circumstances under which it was created, when one contemplates the identities of
              those who authored it, and when one studies its actual performance over the years, it becomes obvious that
              the System is merely a cartel with a government façade.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10"
                class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Antony Sutton, Professor of Economics at California State University sums it up this way:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Even today,...academic theoreticians cover their blackboards with meaningless equations, and the general
              public struggles in bewildered confusion with inflation and the coming credit collapse, while the quite
              simple explanation of the problem goes undiscussed and almost entirely uncomprehended. <strong>The Federal
                Reserve System is a legal private monopoly of the money supply operated for the benefit of the few under
                the guise of protecting and promoting the public interest.</strong><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11"
                class="footnote">[11]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>If the system cannot meet its stated objectives, and if those stated objectives were never more than bait
            used to get us on the hook<em>,</em> then there is no reason why this creature should be permitted to
            breathe another day. Congress created it. Congress can, <em>and should</em>, kill it.</p>

            <p>[4] Regarding the term currency drain: Today, the term "currency drain" is almost always used to
              describe the removal of currency from the banking system and the loss of "excess reserves" that this
              causes. However, here the term is used to describe a problem that banks faced "Pre-Federal Reserve
              System." (Prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve System, it was not uncommon for reckless banks to
              "inflate deposits" far more than others. This invariably led to a "drain" on the reckless bank's currency,
              as described here.) <a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p>
