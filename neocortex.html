              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">Dear "X," <br> <br>
                It appears that there is some kind of disconnect. <br> <br>
                I keep saying how I feel about this manipulative anti-American bullshit (anti-American in the sense that
                it is promoting an agenda that undermines all the core principles of our country) and yet you keep
                sending it. <br> <br>
                If you have so much faith in our government that you support SUSPECTS being rounded up (many of them
                <a href="http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2006/09/29/amnesty_prisoners_captured_on_cash_reward/5158/"
                  target="_blank">sold to the military</a> by drug lords for up to $250,000 "Afghan dollars" each) put
                in secret prisons, denied the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_carta"
                  target="_blank">long-established and BASIC human right</a> to confront those who've accused them of a
                crime and challenge their detention...then fine. <br> <br>
                This pathetic tactic of pointing to a group of barbarians who are guilty of a crime, and then saying
                THEIR ACT somehow justifies what has been done to people who are guilty of NO CRIME at all (save the
                "crime" of being arbitrarily named a "suspect" in a lawless land) demonstrates a lack of <a
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking" target="_blank">critical thinking</a> skills I
                can hardly fathom. Worse, it invariably spills over into justifying all sorts of other
                indefensible actions (like the slaughter of hundreds of thousands / millions of people who haven’t even
                been accused of a crime.) <br> <br>
                It depresses me to think people can be so easily manipulated into supporting lawless / tyrannical
                government policies. This is exactly the type of propaganda that has fueled every great "government-led"
                atrocity in modern history. The people concocting and disseminating this crap know exactly what they’re
                doing…they appeal to the primitive (reactive) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain"
                  target="_blank">reptilian brain</a> and let fear, hate, and hysteria do the rest. <br> <br> So how
                about we “evolve” a little and stop falling for it? How about, instead of ignoring our greatest
                evolutionary asset, we actually use that “neocortex” of ours that (supposedly) makes us the earth’s
                smartest animal? It’s either that or accept our role as mindless herd animals – controlled by a ruthless
                and cunning "intellectual elite" who are happy to prove (and benefit from) their mental "superiority."

              Abu Ghraib is not "torture" or an "atrocity". This is the kind of thing frat boys, sorority girls, and
              academy cadets do to newcomers . A little fun at someone else's expense. Certainly no reason to wring your
              hands or get your panties in a wad.<br> <br>
              <p>Got that?</p>

                Islam a peaceful religion??? My Ass! <br> <br>
                Millions of these sons-of-bitches are plotting, as we speak, to destroy our country and our way of life any way they can. <br>
                Some of them are here among us now. <br> <br>

                They don't want to convert you and don't want to rule you. You are a vile infestation of Allah's
                paradise. They don't give a shit how "progressive" you are, how peace-loving you are, or how much you sympathize with their cause. They want your ass dead , and they think it is God's will for them to do it. </p> <br> <br>

                  Some think if we give them a hug or listen to them, then they'll like us... and if you agree? Then you are a pathetic dumb ass! <br>
                  If they manage to get their hands on a nuke, chemical agents, or even some anthrax -- you will wish to God we had hunted them down and killed THEM while we had the chance. <br>
                  How many more Americans must be beheaded ?? You've fallen asleep AGAIN, maggots! And you may not get another chance! </p> <br>
                  NOW GET OFF YOUR SORRY ASS - and pass this on to any and every person you give a damn about.. if you ever gave a damn about anything <br> </BR> <img src="images/eeea75_f5596154aa85400981281fd5e30202c2~mv2.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
