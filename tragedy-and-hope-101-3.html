                        <h1>CHAPTER THREE<br>The Network "Recovers" America</h1>
                    </div>

                    <p>Two men, Cecil Rhodes and Lord Milner, played an indispensable role in the creation and expansion
                        of the Network. Their actions changed the world forever, and for that reason no depiction of the
                        Network (or modern history for that matter) would be complete without mentioning their names.
                    </p>

                    <p>Likewise, two additional men played an indispensable role in helping the Network achieve one of
                        its crucial goals: regaining control of the United States of America. The first man, Edward
                        Mandell House, was clearly a willing and deceptive servant. The second man, President Woodrow
                        Wilson, was almost certainly a well-meaning dupe. But before bringing these two additional
                        characters into the story, let's touch on <em>why</em> it was necessary for the Network to
                        "recover" the United States and destroy its political and economic sovereignty.</p>

                    <h2>Global Domination 101</h2>

                    <p>There is always one nonnegotiable element in any plan to secure global domination: sovereign
                        nations (truly <em>independent</em> nations) cannot be tolerated. Why? Because global domination
                        is about centralizing all power into the would-be rulers' hands. Independent nations impede this
                        consolidation and disturb the proper chain of command.</p>

                    <p>This seems straightforward enough, but, since it's rarely boiled down to its simplest form, it's
                        worth repeating: to rule the world, <strong>you must first destroy national
                            sovereignty</strong>. You must consolidate and control the <em>real</em> levers of power,
                        regardless of the different <em>forms</em> of government that appear in each country.</p>

                    <p>If "democratic forms" of government can persuade the majority to accept your global policies,
                        then democratic forms should be used. If tyrannical forms of government are more effective at
                        gaining compliance, then let there be tyranny. If shifting from one form of government to
                        another (turning nations and societies on their head) provides an opportunity to obtain your
                        objectives; so be it. All that truly matters is that <em>you</em> control the <em>leaders</em>
                        who appear to hold power and that you can contain or destroy those leaders if they forget (or
                        simply haven't realized) who the real master is.</p>

                    <p>This is what Quigley meant when he said the Network's members are "satisfied to possess the
                        reality rather than the appearance of power."<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a>
                        To the extent that they direct the political and economic machinery of nations, and to the
                        extent they can destroy national sovereignty and impose <em>their</em> policies on the citizens
                        of the world, they possess the <em>reality</em> of power. Accordingly, anything that weakens
                        national sovereignty is their ally; anything that strengthens it is their enemy.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, as Ed Griffin points out in <em>The Quigley Formula</em>, many people struggle to
                        believe that their highly respected "leaders" are conspiring to cheat them out of truly
                        representative government. After all, our leaders constantly sing the praises of representative
                        government. They tell us that the citizens are sovereign, <em>voters</em> control national
                        policies, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous. After a lifetime of being fed this
                        version of reality, the idea of a global conspiracy to destroy national sovereignty (involving
                        both government and government advisors) is, understandably, difficult to accept. But the
                        greatest weapon against knee-jerk disbelief often comes directly from the conspirators
                        themselves. For instance, Arnold J. Toynbee (a high-ranking member of the Network), left little
                        doubt when he wrote:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>I will hereby repeat that we are at present working discreetly but with all of our might to
                            wrest this mysterious political force called sovereignty out of the clutches of the local
                            national states of our world. <strong>And all the time we are denying with our lips</strong>
                            what we are doing with our hands.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As Quigley discovered, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is nothing more than a front group
                        for the Network.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a> This being the case, its
                        position on national sovereignty is predictable. Here are a few choice quotes from CFR members
                        taken from <em>Dishonest Money: Financing the Road to Ruin</em>, page 69:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"The house of world order will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top
                            down…an end run around national sovereignty, <strong>eroding it piece by piece</strong>,
                            will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault."—CFR member Richard
                            Gardner</p>

                        <p>"<strong>We shall have world government, whether or not we like it.</strong> The question is
                            only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest."—CFR member James
                            Paul Warburg</p>

                        <p>"Some dilution…of the sovereignty system as it prevails in the world today must take place…to
                            the immediate disadvantage of those nations which now possess the preponderance of
                            power…<strong>The United States must be prepared to make sacrifices…in setting up a world
                                politico-economic order</strong>."—CFR member Foster Dulles</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Admiral Chester Ward, a longtime CFR member who later became a harsh critic, summed up the
                        prevailing goal of the CFR this way: "the submergence of US sovereignty and national
                        independence into an all-powerful one-world government."</p>

                    <p>Again, this policy toward national sovereignty shouldn't come as a surprise. The CFR is simply a
                        creation of the Network, and, as such, it <em>was created</em> to help the Network achieve its
                        goals. And though the CFR is just one of many instruments in the Network's arsenal, it is among
                        the most powerful. Even though CFR members constitute only about .0015 percent of the US
                        population, they have held, and currently hold, an inexplicably high percentage of the most
                        influential positions in our society.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>Almost all</strong> of America's leadership has come from this small group. That
                            includes presidents and their advisors, cabinet members, ambassadors, board members of the
                            Federal Reserve System, directors of the largest banks and investment houses, presidents of
                            universities, and heads of metropolitan newspapers, news services, and TV networks.<a
                                href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Before moving on, it's worth mentioning one additional and extremely important reason why the
                        Network sought to regain control of the United States: just as the British government became a
                        powerful <em>instrument</em> in the Network's toolbox, the United States offered an even greater
                        opportunity. By seizing control of US foreign policy, the Network could now access the untapped
                        military, economic, and political resources of America. It could use those resources to continue
                        what's best described as its sovereignty-destruction project. As an added bonus, it could chain
                        the political consequences and inescapable debt to the United States. And that's exactly what it
                        has done.</p>

                    <p>For instance, since it was founded in 1947, the CIA (a creation of the Network)<a href="#fn5"
                            id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a> has been used to destabilize and topple dozens of
                        uncooperative nations covertly<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a> while the US
                        military (controlled by policy makers that are dominated by the Network) has been used to topple
                        dozens directly. Again, the costs and blowback accrue to the United States; the benefits go to
                        the Network. True, the United States does enjoy the "benefit" of <em>appearing</em> supremely
                        powerful, but this is only a cruel joke. When the Network is satisfied that all major obstacles
                        to its unelected rule have been removed, it will be a simple matter to destroy the US dollar,
                        "justifiably" cut off the flow of money and credit to the United States, and create the
                        political incentive (<em>necessity</em>) for the United States to fully enter the new global
                        system.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, none of the Network's actions to this point (and none of its future plans) would have
                        been possible without first seizing the levers of power in the United States. So for now, let's
                        return to the two men who made that possible.</p>

                    <h2>A Willing and Deceptive Servant</h2>

                    <p>An unattractive and physically average man stands, alone and depressed, beneath an oak tree at
                        the prestigious West Point Military Academy. It's graduation day. In the distance, his peers
                        (the Class of 1920) anxiously await their chance to lead the army and the free world into the
                        twentieth century. The president of the United States, his secretary of defense, and other
                        distinguished guests are in attendance to honor the occasion, and this adds to what most see as
                        an already-intoxicating atmosphere. All are filled with excitement and a sense of purpose…all
                        but the man who stands beneath the oak.</p>

                    <p>Unlike his peers, he has paid attention to the world around him. He has studied the insidious
                        influence of unrestrained wealth tearing at the fabric of the nation. Even the army itself had
                        become little more than a prostitute in recent decades, forced to serve the interests of those
                        who'd accumulated riches "beyond all bounds of need."</p>

                    <p>He quietly dreams of a "much-to-be-desired state of society," built upon the tenets of "socialism
                        as dreamed of by Karl Marx."<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a> Our hero, a
                        "masterly man of prodigious intellect," resolves to hasten "a revolutionary adjustment" of US
                        society.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a> But before he can fix the republic,
                        he must first destroy it. He must overthrow the government, declare himself dictator, and shred
                        that "obsolete" and "vulgar" document on which the republic was founded (the US Constitution.)
                        He alone will decide the laws of the nation…He will ensure the "desires of the people" are
                        better met.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a> (Unless, of course, some of the
                        people <em>desire</em> to resist his edicts; there will be no representation for them. They will
                        be put to death. Likewise, the exercise of free speech against the dictator's policies will not
                        be tolerated.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a>)</p>

                    <p>If you've been checking footnotes over the past few paragraphs, you've noticed multiple
                        references to a book entitled <em>Phillip Dru: Administrator</em>. It's a novel, originally
                        published anonymously in 1912. Why reference this novel, you ask? Because we can learn a great
                        deal about the "willing and deceptive servant" (Edward Mandell House) from the book's
                        anti-American message.</p>

                    <p>To briefly recap: <em>Phillip Dru: Administrator</em> is the tale of an "intellectually superior"
                        man who conspires to overthrow the US government, assume dictatorial powers, and pave the way
                        for "socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx." Our good-hearted hero concludes, along with other
                        characters in the book, that the people are simply incapable of determining their own best
                        interests. As such, "a revolutionary adjustment" of their government (whether they like it or
                        not), is necessary. The hero and his fellow conspirators set out to remake the United States as
                        they see fit, and succeed.</p>

                    <p>If you haven't already guessed, <em>Phillip Dru: Administrator</em> was written by none other
                        than Edward Mandell House himself.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a> In the
                        book, House argues that dictatorship is necessary because the rich and powerful have taken
                        control, and they're using their power against the poor and less fortunate. To understand how
                        shamefully cynical this is, consider the fact that House's propaganda was meant to strengthen,
                        not weaken, the same "rich and powerful" individuals that his book condemned.</p>

                            itself), whip up an emotional firestorm, and, at the peak of hysteria, offer a
                            <em>solution</em> that furthers its own agenda.</p>

                    <p>Maybe this is why House published his novel anonymously. It would be pretty hard to hook readers
                        with his fight-the-elite storyline if they knew the author was "one of the first 'kingmakers' in
                        modern American politics."<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a> In any event,
                        the book is worth reading, not for its entertainment value (it isn't well written), but because
                        it's a short read that provides many insights into how easily a handful of men can manipulate a
                        <em>democratic</em> system of government. Some notable examples include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How a senator can <em>pretend</em> to represent the citizens who voted for him while
                            actually representing the "special interests" that he was elected to fight (page 35)</li>
                        <li>How kingmakers, before throwing their weight behind a candidate, ensure that the indebted
                            candidate will choose "advisors" from the kingmaker's approved list (page 38)</li>
                        <li>If a puppet official gets out of line, how to bring them back under control (have the press
                            attack them and have other powerful government puppets do the same, page 46)</li>
                        <li>How to use the regulatory power of government to collect tributes and funnel tax money into
                            companies <em>you</em> choose. How to be "generous" with other people's money and use that
                            <em>generosity</em> to strengthen your hold on political power (page 94)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The book even takes a few contemptuous shots at the electorate itself. For instance, when
                        describing one of the major instruments that's used to manipulate elected officials, we learn
                        that the press "can make or destroy a man's legislative and political career, and the weak and
                        the vain and the men with shifty consciences, that <strong>the people in their fatuous
                            indifference elect to make their laws</strong>, seldom fail to succumb to this subtle
                        influence" (page 120).</p>

                    <p>As already mentioned, House himself was a kingmaker. His connections to the Network gave him the
                        power to make or break aspiring politicians, and he exercised this power with great skill. Prior
                        to turning his attention to the national stage, House is credited with helping four different
                        candidates secure the governorship of Texas.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13"
                            class="footnote">[13]</a> But of all the <em>kings</em> that House managed to make, none
                        paid better dividends than Woodrow Wilson.</p>

                    <p>Carefully selected and manipulated, House used Wilson to create the two essential funding
                        mechanisms for the Network's "revolutionary adjustment" of US society. More specifically: prior
                        to the election of Woodrow Wilson, the Network did <em>not</em> possess the power to tax US
                        citizens' income or control the nation's money supply. Wilson signed both of these powers into
                        existence shortly after he took office. More than anything, this enabled House and the Network
                        to turn the United States away from sovereignty and toward servitude.</p>

                    <p>Professor Thomas J. Knock provides this keen insight into the relevance of House's book,
                        <em>Philip Dru: Administrator</em>:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Philip Dru deserves serious attention if only for the prophetic self-exposition of its
                            author. Clearly, House's driving ambition in life was to influence the course of history. To
                            an extent, he succeeded…He was right on the mark when he wrote: "I was like a disembodied
                            spirit seeking a corporeal form. I found my opportunity in Woodrow Wilson."<a href="#fn14"
                                id="fnref14" class="footnote">[14]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Woodrow Wilson, a Well-Meaning Dupe</h2>

                    <p>Before the Network chooses a candidate for a particular job, that candidate must be carefully
                        screened. This obviously isn't a problem for those who have intelligence agencies and other
                        investigative resources at their disposal. A vast amount of personal information can be easily
                        collected on <em>any</em> individual<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a> and,
                        if the individual looks promising, a recruiter (like Mandell House) will know exactly what
                        buttons to push to entice and or manipulate the new recruit. To say that Wilson must have looked
                        very promising to the Network would be a colossal understatement. He had demonstrated loyalty to
                        the ideals of global government and socialism, as well as contempt for the US Constitution, long
                        before House selected him<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote">[16]</a> for the
                        presidency.</p>

                    <p>In his book <em>To End All Wars: Woodrow Wilson and the Quest for a New World Order</em>, Thomas
                        J. Knock (a supporter of Wilson) provides a detailed look into Wilson's mind. The similarities
                        between Wilson and the so-called hero in <em>Philip Dru: Administrator</em> are very disturbing.
                        Assuming the Network sought to establish a centralized world government, they could have hardly
                        found a better advocate than Woodrow Wilson.</p>

                    <p>As early as 1887, Wilson had written of a "confederation" of empires<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17"
                            class="footnote">[17]</a> and expressed his agreement with the central idea behind state
                        socialism. That idea, he wrote, is that "no line can be drawn between private and public affairs
                        which the State may not cross at will…it is very clear that in fundamental theory socialism and
                        democracy are almost if not quite one and the same."<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18"
                            class="footnote">[18]</a></p>

                    <p>In Wilson's opinion, the US government needed to move toward centralized socialist control and
                        unlimited power in order to stop "the aggrandizement of giant corporations that threatened to
                        swallow up, not only individuals and small businesses, but democratic government itself." Wilson
                        went on to condemn "selfish, misguided individualism" and proclaimed "we ought all to regard
                        ourselves as socialists." He saw that concentrated and unaccountable power had enabled "the rich
                        and strong to combine against the poor and weak," and it was high time for government to "lay
                        aside" timidity and "make itself an agency for social reform as well as political control."<a
                            href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a></p>

                    <p>Each of these arguments is nearly identical to those offered by House's fictional hero. But
                        unlike House (who used the arguments deceptively, to justify seizing greater power), Wilson
                        probably believed that his solutions would weaken the monopolistic forces he spoke out against.
                        And, if so, this made Wilson much more valuable to the Network than the typical insincere
                        politician who'd say anything in exchange for a paycheck and some power. Wilson would openly and
                        <em>passionately</em> build for the Network what it could never openly build for itself.</p>

                    <p>But if these aspects of Wilson's personality and ideology were not enough, there was one final
                        asset that the Network could exploit: Woodrow Wilson was a man of towering arrogance and
                        hypocrisy. He had no aversion to the creation of imperial power, provided it was directed by the
                        "right people" (like himself, no doubt) and provided it was used for the "right reasons" (to be
                        determined by the same.) In the case of the United States, he stated, "I believe that God
                        planted in us visions of liberty…that we are chosen…to show the way to the nations of the world
                        how they shall walk in the paths of liberty."<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20"
                            class="footnote">[20]</a></p>

                    <p>As with most politicians, when Wilson uses the pronoun "we" (as in "we are chosen"), he would
                        have been more honest to use the pronoun "<em>I</em>." More to the point: he felt that God had
                        chosen <em>him</em> to secure global liberty by force, and there is at least one reference,
                        provided by Sigmund Freud, where Wilson drops all rhetorical subterfuge:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>God ordained that I should be the next President of the United States. Neither you nor any
                            other mortal or mortals could have prevented it.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21"
                                class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Additional quotes further clarify the strength of Wilson's ego. For instance, in his confidential
                        journal, he wrote: "Why may not the present generation write, through me, its political
                        autobiography."<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote">[22]</a> In an address he gave as
                        president (July 4, 1914), Wilson proclaimed that the role of the United States was to be "the
                        light which shall shine unto all generations and guide the feet of mankind to the goal of
                        justice and liberty and peace."<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a> And to
                        achieve this, Wilson generously pledged "every dollar" of America's wealth, "every drop of her
                        blood," and all the "energy of her people."<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24"
                            class="footnote">[24]</a></p>

                    <p>Even Henry Kissinger took aim at Wilson's "conceit":</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In Wilson's view, there was no essential difference between freedom for America and freedom
                            for the world…he developed an extraordinary interpretation of what George Washington had
                            really meant when he warned against foreign entanglements. Wilson redefined "foreign" in a
                            way that would surely have astonished the first president. What Washington meant, according
                            to Wilson, was that America must avoid becoming entangled in the <em>purposes</em> of
                            others. But, Wilson argued, nothing that concerns humanity "can be foreign or indifferent to
                            us." Hence America had an unlimited charter to involve itself abroad…what extraordinary
                            conceit to derive a charter for global intervention from a Founding Father's injunction
                            against foreign entanglements, and to elaborate a philosophy of neutrality that made
                            involvement in war inevitable!<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote">[25]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Wilson's desire to create a global power structure that "no nation" or "probable combination of
                        nations" could resist,<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote">[26]</a> coupled with his
                        messiah complex, provided the perfect psychological ingredients for turning the man into a
                        useful idiot.<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote">[27]</a> Servando Gonzales summed up
                        the final equation perfectly: "Wilson was a man intoxicated with the sense of his own importance
                        and historical relevance" and, as such, he could be "easily manipulated by a trained
                        intelligence officer (like Edward Mandell House)."<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28"
                            class="footnote">[28]</a></p>

                    <p>The evidence suggests that this is exactly what happened. The Network had no reason to reveal
                        itself or its New World Order plans to Wilson. Rather, it had every reason to let him believe
                        the crusade for global government was <em>his</em> idea, his divine purpose, to "make the world
                        safe for democracy."</p>

                    <p>In his book, <em>The New Freedom</em>, Woodrow Wilson spoke out against a shadowy monopolistic
                        power that was exercising undue influence in the United States. He wrote:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of
                            the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid
                            of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so
                            organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had
                            better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.<a href="#fn29"
                                id="fnref29" class="footnote">[29]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>How ironic that this same "organized, watchful, and pervasive" power is what put Woodrow Wilson
                        in the White House…and this brings us to another very important part of the story.</p>

                    <p>Assuming we accept the fact that Wilson was a dupe, cynically used by the Network to further its
                        already-established agenda, we still haven't addressed the most impressive swindle of all: that
                        the Network successfully duped millions of Americans into electing him in the first place.</p>

                    <h2>The Election Deception</h2>

                    <p>Few voters ever stop to consider the way in which they initially meet "their" choices for
                        president. If a strange man were to knock on their door and say "I'm running for president of
                        the United States," there is almost zero chance they'd view him as a legitimate candidate.
                        However, if they meet <em>the exact same stranger</em> through one of the Network's main
                        propaganda instruments (radio, print, or television), suddenly the reaction is very different.
                        Suddenly the stranger <em>deserves</em> a serious look.</p>

                    <p>This is what Bernays referred to as "one of the most firmly established principles of mass
                        psychology," and the Network applies the principle masterfully. Essentially, it is this: the
                        vast majority of people accept the idea that "<em>credible"</em> individuals and organizations
                        should be trusted to do their reasoning <em>for</em> them.</p>

                    <p>In the case of elections, the public trusts the so-called credible media to narrow the field down
                        to the top-tier candidates. A political "sideshow" ensues and, at the end, voters choose who
                        they'd prefer to have in office. But their choice isn't what they perceive it to be. Sure, they
                        <em>are</em> technically choosing who they prefer, but they are choosing from a list of
                        candidates <em>that was chosen</em> for them.</p>

                    <p>Sadly, this sleight of hand works just as well today as it did one hundred years ago. And unless
                        this concept becomes widely understood, it will work one hundred years from now as well.
                        Returning to Bernays, from his book <em>Propaganda</em>:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Political campaigns today are all sideshows, all honors, all bombast, glitter, and speeches.
                            These are for the most part unrelated to the main business of studying the public
                            scientifically, of <strong>supplying the public with party, candidate,
                                platform</strong>…<strong>and selling the public these ideas and products.</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In short: without the Network's backing, a candidate will remain a relative nobody in the
                        election. They will be relegated to begging door to door for enough money to run an (almost
                        meaningless) advertising campaign. However, <em>with</em> Network backing, the candidate can
                        count on millions of dollars in campaign donations, a long list of credible endorsements, and a
                        nearly priceless amount of exposure through the Network's propaganda instruments. (In the
                        unlikely event that a truly independent candidate emerges, with enough money or a large-enough
                        following to gain some ground, the Network will simply use its instruments to smear and
                        ostracize the candidate and the candidate's supporters.)</p>

                    <p>To be clear, this isn't to suggest that the Network-backed candidates are necessarily involved in
                        the election deception. "President of the United States" is a job title that fewer than
                        forty-five men have held. The desire to join the ranks of such an exclusive club, with all of
                        its attendant perks, is undoubtedly very real. The candidates might even genuinely disagree with
                        a few positions held by their opponents. In fact, it's even better if they do. (The meaningless
                        bickering between them, and the partisan hysteria it incites among the public, only adds to the
                        overall illusion of voter choice.) But on the issues that matter most to the Network, each
                        sponsored candidate is virtually identical in value.</p>

                    <p>The beauty of this system is its simplicity. The Network scouts potential talent, performs the
                        necessary background checks, and, after conveying its expectations, offers its vital assistance
                        to a handful of candidates. After some "bombast, glitter, and speeches," the public chooses from
                        the products (party, candidate, and platform) that were put before them.</p>

                    <p>Now, let's quickly expand a little on <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the Network ousted incumbent
                        president William Howard Taft and installed Woodrow Wilson.</p>

                    <h2>Summary of the 1912 Coup</h2>

                    <p>The 1912 election presented an incredible opportunity for the Network. Although William Howard
                        Taft had served the conspirators well (by openly entertaining the idea of relinquishing US
                        sovereignty and supporting the Network's long-sought funding mechanism, the income tax<a
                            href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote">[30]</a>), he'd failed to support the one measure
                        that was more important than all others. He refused to support Nelson Aldrich's plan to hand the
                        nation's money supply over to the Network through the creation of a central bank.<a href="#fn31"
                            id="fnref31" class="footnote">[31]</a> Since the central bank was necessary to truly
                        dominate the United States, Taft's rejection of the Aldrich plan constituted a major
                        transgression. But there was a remedy, and that remedy's name was Woodrow Wilson.</p>

                    <p>Wilson had done more than "openly entertain the idea of relinquishing national sovereignty," he'd
                        developed a near-fanatical obsession with the idea. There would be no problem getting him to
                        passionately evangelize the New World Order on behalf of the Network.</p>

                    <p>It would also be no problem getting Wilson to sign the Network's income-tax scam into law. (The
                        income tax was sold as a way to punish the rich and enrich the poor. In reality, the tax simply
                        extracts money from US citizens and dumps it directly into the Network's projects and pockets.)
                    </p>

                    <p>Last but certainly not least, control of the nation's money supply would be far easier to secure
                        with Wilson in the White House. For one reason, Wilson admitted that he really didn't understand
                        central banking,<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote">[32]</a> and this was
                        <em>very</em> convenient. The Network could provide all the "right" advisors, steering the
                        creation of the so-called Federal Reserve System from start to finish.</p>

                    <p>Another reason the central bank would be easier to secure under Wilson is because the entire
                        issue had been successfully framed in partisan terms. That is, a previous central-bank plan had
                        been put forward by a Republican senator named Nelson Aldrich. Since everyone knew that Aldrich
                        was a Network-connected insider, the legislation was shot down by Democrats when it bore his
                        name. (For this, the Democrats were largely seen as having protected the little guy from another
                        big-business Republican scheme.)</p>

                    <p>With the people convinced that the Democrats had protected them, any alternative central-bank
                        plan put forward under a Democratic administration would rouse far less suspicion. The Network
                        could simply drop the name "Aldrich," wrap the legislation in some <em>progressive</em>
                        rhetoric, and sell the exact same thing with Wilson and his Democratic administration acting as
                        trusted pitchmen. (Like the income tax, the central bank would be presented as a way to "protect
                        the people" from the rich and powerful. In truth, it accomplished the exact opposite.)</p>

                    <div class="side-note">
                        <p><strong>Side Note</strong>: The central-bank issue is so crucial to the Network's plan for
                            dominating the world that I've written an entire book on the subject.<a href="#fn33"
                                id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a> A sizable amount of the next chapter will be
                            devoted to this topic, but, for now, here is what Quigley said the Network intended to
                            create with its central banking power:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>…a world system of financial control in private hands able to <strong>dominate the
                                    political system of each country</strong>…The apex of the system was to be…<strong>a
                                    private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves
                                    private corporations</strong>. <strong>Each central bank</strong>…<strong>sought to
                                    dominate its government</strong> by its ability to control Treasury loans, to
                                manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the
                                country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the
                                business world.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote">[34]</a></p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>

                    <p>As a quick reminder, this isn't a case of Quigley <em>guessing</em> at the Network's intentions.
                        He speaks with the authority of a man who, in his own words, <em>knows</em> "of the operations
                        of this network" because he "studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the
                        early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records."<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35"
                            class="footnote">[35]</a></p>

                    <p>So, when comparing the Republican candidate, Taft, to the Democratic candidate, Wilson, there was
                        no question who the Network wanted more. The decision was made, Mandell House paid Wilson a
                        visit, and the process of grooming Wilson for the presidency began.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In November 1911, Wilson met Colonel Edward Mandell House, one of the first kingmakers in
                            modern American politics. "Almost from the first," the Colonel later recalled, "our minds
                            vibrated in unison." Wilson concurred: "Mr. House is my second personality…His thoughts and
                            mine are one."<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote">[36]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>James Perloff describes a follow-up meeting at the Democratic Party headquarters in New York:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Wilson received an "indoctrination course" from the leaders convened there, during which he
                            agreed, in principle, to do the following if elected:</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Support the projected Federal Reserve [central bank];</li>
                        <li>Support income tax;</li>
                        <li>Lend an ear to advice should war break out in Europe;</li>
                        <li>Lend an ear to advice on who should occupy his cabinet.<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37"
                                class="footnote">[37]</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As mentioned in footnote 16, House pulled all of the necessary strings to ensure the Democratic
                        nomination for president went to Wilson. But as impressive as that level of influence might be,
                        it's still a long way from actually putting a man in the White House. And, unfortunately for the
                        Network, Taft was <em>heavily</em> favored to win against its preferred candidate. Not a
                        problem.</p>

                    <p>As "luck" would have it, the Network found another potential candidate that it could run against
                        Taft. Not just any candidate, mind you, but a former two-term Republican president. And not just
                        any two-term Republican president, but the same one that Republican President Taft had just
                        replaced in 1909: Teddy Roosevelt.</p>

                    <p>This was a brilliant strategic move. The most obvious reason being, ten months prior to the 1912
                        election, Roosevelt had expressed a willingness to support the Aldrich plan.<a href="#fn38"
                            id="fnref38" class="footnote">[38]</a> Therefore, whether Wilson or Roosevelt won, the
                        Network could get its central bank. But the most obvious reason isn't the only or best reason
                        for why the Network poured more than ten million dollars<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39"
                            class="footnote">[39]</a> (inflation adjusted) into Roosevelt's campaign. Sure, Roosevelt
                        was acceptable, but the Network still <em>preferred</em> Wilson. And by splitting the vote, they
                        could have him. Perloff explains:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Polls showed incumbent President Taft as a clear favorite over the stiff-looking professor
                            from Princeton. So, <strong>to divide the Republican vote</strong>, the [Network] put money
                            behind Teddy Roosevelt on the Progressive Party ticket. J.P. Morgan and Co. was the
                            financial backbone of the Roosevelt campaign. The strategy succeeded. Republican ballots
                            were split between Taft and Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson became President with only
                            forty-two percent of the popular vote.<a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote">[40]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The full results of the 1912 election were as follows: Wilson received 41.8 percent of the vote,
                        Roosevelt received 27.4 percent, and Taft received only 23.2 percent.<a href="#fn41"
                            id="fnref41" class="footnote">[41]</a> How is that for impressive? William Howard Taft, a
                        man who would have handily won the election with a strong majority, wound up dead last in a
                        three-way race against two Network-manufactured candidates. House summed it up this way: "Wilson
                        was elected by Teddy Roosevelt."<a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote">[42]</a> The rest,
                        as they say, is history.</p>

                    <p>After the election, House proceeded to fill the president's important cabinet positions with the
                        best advisors the Network had to offer. He guided Wilson's policy decisions like a "disembodied
                        spirit" that had "found its opportunity" to shape the world with Wilson's hands.</p>

                    <p>Before the end of 1913, the income tax would be law. Before the end of 1913, the central bank
                        would be a reality. These new instruments provided the funding and leverage that the Network
                        needed to greatly accelerate its sovereignty-destruction project. But they, alone, would not
                        provide the greatest opportunity to capitalize on Wilson's evangelical crusade to "make the
                        world safe for democracy." Only a long and protracted world war, with funding guaranteed by the
                        new instruments, could achieve that.</p>

                    <p>Once again, as luck would have it, just such an opportunity presented itself shortly after Wilson
                        took office. World War I provided the political impetus for the Network's first major attempt at
                        establishing a global government (the League of Nations). And although it wasn't as successful
                        as they might have hoped, the League of Nations, along with all the other "instruments" that
                        came into existence under Wilson, laid the foundation for all of the Network's progress over the
                        past one hundred years.</p>
