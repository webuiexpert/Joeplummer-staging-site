                        <h1>CHAPTER NINE<br>Realpolitik Revisited</h1>
                    </div>

                    <p>Though the philosophy of Realpolitik was briefly covered in chapter 1, and though everything
                        written to this point demonstrates the Network's devotion to its principles, nothing captures
                        the cold and calculating nature of its adherents like the false-flag operation. Any willingness
                        to engage in these ruthless deceptions provides definitive proof of an abnormal/sociopathic
                        disregard for ethical considerations.</p>

                    <p>Normal human beings accept the nearly universal maxim that <em>morality</em> determines whether
                        an action is right or wrong. Practitioners of Realpolitik, on the other hand, unapologetically
                        reject this maxim. In their view, right and wrong are measured only in results. If they succeed
                        in securing their objective, what they have done is right. If they fail in securing their
                        objective, what they have done is wrong. They see themselves as <em>realists,</em> and dismiss
                        those who criticize the immorality of their actions as impractical fools.</p>

                    <p>If forced to do so, the realist might offer a moral justification for their immoral actions,<a
                            href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a> but the offer is insincere. Might and
                        manipulation have led them to the apex of power and, as such, they have no incentive to question
                        their approach. They are supremely arrogant. They think and behave differently than you and I;
                        we must be aware of this.</p>

                    <p>In this final chapter, I hope to remove any doubt about the nature of those we're up against.</p>

                    <h2>Carr, Kissinger, FDR, and Churchill</h2>

                    <p>Perhaps you've heard the joke "If you look up the definition of evil, you'll see a picture of
                        (enter name here) prominently displayed at the top of the page." Well, it's no joke to say, "If
                        you look up the definition of <em>Realpolitik</em> at Wikipedia, you'll see Henry Kissinger and
                        E. H. Carr listed as two prominent practitioners."<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"
                            class="footnote">[2]</a> Since Carr is unknown to most, let's begin with him.</p>

                    <p>E. H. Carr was a highly influential British historian and member of the Network<a href="#fn3"
                            id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a> who believed it was <em>his</em> role to "work out the
                        basis of a new international order." As a realist, Carr considered the Soviet Union's
                        collectivist/totalitarian system of control far superior to the individualism practiced in the
                        West. In fact, he praised Karl Marx "for emphasizing the importance of the collective over the
                        individual."<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Carr described realism as the acceptance that what exists is right…He argued that in realism
                            there is no moral dimension, and that what is successful is right, and what is unsuccessful
                            is wrong. [As an example, he supported the Bolshevik Revolution based on the grounds of
                            Realpolitik.]<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In his 1942 book <em>Conditions of Peace</em>, Carr argued that it was a flawed economic
                            system that had caused World War II and that the only way of preventing another world war
                            was for the Western powers to fundamentally change the economic basis of their societies by
                            adopting socialism.</p>

                        <p>In 1945 during a lecture series entitled <em>The Soviet Impact on the Western World</em>…Carr
                            argued that "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere
                            unmistakable," that Marxism was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism…and that
                            only the "blind and incurable ignored these trends"…Carr claimed that Soviet social policies
                            were far more progressive than Western social policies, and argued democracy was more about
                            social equality than political rights.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Regarding the "more progressive" policies and "social equality" under the Soviet system, Quigley
                        provides some insight:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>[For Communism to work in Russia, the Bolsheviks believed that the country needed to be]
                            industrialized at breakneck speed, whatever the waste and hardships…This meant that the
                            goods produced by the peasants must be taken from them…without any economic return, and that
                            the ultimate in authoritarian terror must be used.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7"
                                class="footnote">[7]</a></p>

                        <p>All peasants who resisted were treated with violence; their property was confiscated, they
                            were beaten or sent into exile…many were killed. This process, known as "the liquidation of
                            the kulaks"…affected five million kulak families.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"
                                class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

                        <p>The ordinary Russian had inadequate food and housing, was subject to extended rationing…and
                            was reduced to living, with his family, in a single room or even, in many cases, to a corner
                            of a single room shared with other families. The privileged rulers and their favorites had
                            the best of everything, including foods and wines, the use of vacation villas in the
                            country…the use of official cars in the city, the right to live in old czarist palaces and
                            mansions.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>

                        <p>As public discontent and social tensions grew…the use of spying, purges, torture, and murder
                            increased out of all proportion…By the middle 1930's the search for "saboteurs" and for
                            "enemies of the state"…left hardly a family untouched. <strong>Hundreds of thousands were
                                killed</strong>, frequently on completely false charges, while <strong>millions</strong>
                            were arrested and exiled to Siberia or put into huge slave-labor camps. In these camps,
                            under conditions of semi-starvation and incredible cruelty, millions toiled…Estimates of the
                            number of persons (prior to 1941) vary from as low as two million to as high as twenty
                            million. <strong>The majority of these prisoners had done nothing</strong>…[they] consisted
                            of relatives, associates, and friends of persons who had been arrested on more serious
                            charges. Many of these charges were completely false, having been trumped up to provide
                            labor in remote areas, scapegoats for administrative breakdowns, and to eliminate possible
                            rivals in the control of the Soviet system.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10"
                                class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Carr not only admired the greater <em>social equality</em> that citizens enjoyed under the Soviet
                        regime, he argued that "China was much better off under the leadership of Mao Zedong…"<a
                            href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a> Mao, of course, was the Network's most
                        successful monster of all. He murdered between eighteen million and thirty-two million human
                        beings during his collectivist <em>Great Leap Forward</em>. ("Coercion, terror, and systematic
                        violence were the very foundation of the Great Leap Forward" and it "motivated one of the most
                        deadly mass killings of human history."<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a>)
                    </p>

                    <p>Needless to say, Carr was also an enthusiastic supporter of the Hitler-empowerment project.
                        Germany under Hitler, Russia under the Bolsheviks and Stalin, China under Mao—they all share the
                        one characteristic that underpins the realist's political philosophy: might makes right.</p>

                    <p><strong>Side Note:</strong> Any political system that subordinates the rights of the individual
                        to some "greater good" like the <em>collective</em> is irresistible to a realist. That's because
                        it not only empowers the realist, but it conceals their power grab (and blatant hypocrisy) in
                        the process. Consider the absurdity of the following scheme: by loudly condemning the
                        selfishness of the evil <em>individual,</em> and by praising the selfless virtue of the
                        so-called <em>collective,</em> realists can build a system that (far from being administered by
                        or for the benefit of the collective), transfers nearly absolute power to a handful of the most
                        dishonest, selfish, and evil <em>individuals</em> that realism can produce.</p>

                    <p>While Carr overlooked the Network-sponsored horrors of Marxism, Nazism, and Maoism, he continued
                        to enthusiastically denounce the injustices of individualism in the Western world. So what
                        exactly was he up to? Carr either suffered from an incurable case of intellectual inconsistency,
                        or he was a very bold practitioner of Realpolitik…or maybe it was a little of both. All that's
                        certain is if we agree to surrender our individual "political rights" as men like Carr would
                        have us do, the Network will gladly construct "the basis of a new international order" for us to
                        enjoy. Its members will fulfill their long-standing promise of "social equality" for all. Then,
                        we can finally live in a world where everyone is <em>equally</em> powerless to resist their
                        sociopathic conspiracies.</p>

                    <h2>A Pretext for Every Policy</h2>

                    <p>Speaking of sociopathic conspiracies, Operation Gladio demonstrates just how far the Network's
                        realists were willing to go in order to subvert the democratic process in Europe. By using the
                        threat of Communism (which they nurtured), and terrorist attacks (which they facilitated), these
                        skilled practitioners of Realpolitik successfully manipulated everyone involved: the Gladio
                        operatives, the citizens, the government, and the media. To summarize:</p>

                    <p>First, the Network recruited a handful of Nazis, terrorists, and other hardcore criminals<a
                            href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a> and told them that, to help fight
                        Communism, they would be armed, paid, and protected as they operated above the law. These Gladio
                        operatives proceeded to commit acts of terrorism against innocent people, which, predictably,
                        drove citizens to "turn to the State" for greater security. Unaware of Gladio, well-meaning
                        government officials and reporters accepted and repeated the lie that Communists were behind the
                        murders. This lie, backed by public fear and outrage, was used to increase the power of the
                        state and crack down on individuals identified as Communists or Communist sympathizers. (Any
                        politician, citizen, or group of individuals who challenged the Network's agenda could easily be
                        smeared with these labels.)</p>

                    <p>Each step of the way, the "Communist threat" provided a single pretext for the Network's brazen
                        global attack on national sovereignty. If this threat didn't exist, they would have needed to
                        create it.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, this tactic of <em>creating</em> pretexts in the form of an enemy, a crisis, or an
                        attack (or all of the above) remains incredibly effective. The average person is unlikely to
                        suspect, let alone accuse, "their own government" of doing something so vile. Not only because
                        it exceeds the socially acceptable limits of distrust, but because the truth, at first, is
                        psychologically intolerable. But these mental barriers must be overcome. If they aren't,
                        <em>realists</em> within the Network will continue to employ false flags and similar deceptions.
                        They will continue to do so for the simple reason that these tactics work.</p>

                    <p>In closing, we'll expand on this idea of <em>creating</em> pretexts, starting with Henry
                        Kissinger's take on the matter.</p>

                    <h2>Pawns in the Great Game</h2>

                    <p>The US "elephant" serves no useful purpose to the Network if the traditionally "isolationist"
                        American people can maintain control of that elephant. Sadly, Americans have yet to realize that
                        what <em>they want</em> is secondary in importance to what the Network decides they shall have,
                        and this is especially true when it comes to war. Working backward from Vietnam to WWII and then
                        to WWI, this becomes abundantly clear. (In each case the American people were lied to. They were
                        told what they <em>wanted to hear</em>, as policy makers secretly conspired against them.)</p>

                    <p>Beginning with Vietnam, Kissinger concedes that the pretext for sending fifty-five thousand
                        Americans to their death (the Gulf of Tonkin "attack") wasn't based on "a full presentation of
                        the facts." However, he minimizes the relevance of the deception by saying it really wasn't "a
                        major factor in America's commitment to ground combat in Vietnam." While President Johnson
                        assured the public that he wasn't seeking a wider war,<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14"
                            class="footnote">[14]</a> the exact opposite was true. Policy makers had already decided
                        against the wishes of the electorate, and that decision would have led us to all-out war, one
                        way or another.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a></p>

                    <p>Ray McGovern, a former CIA analyst and later a harsh critic of the agency, described the
                        escalation to war in Vietnam this way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>During the summer of 1964, President Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were eager to
                            widen the war in Vietnam. They stepped up sabotage and hit-and-run attacks on the coast of
                            North Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>Those of us in intelligence, not to mention President Lyndon Johnson, Defense Secretary
                            Robert McNamara, and National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, all knew full well that the
                            evidence of any armed attack on the evening of Aug. 4, 1964, the so-called "second" Tonkin
                            Gulf incident, was highly dubious. But it fit the president's purposes, so they lent a hand
                            to facilitate escalation of the war.</p>

                        <p>In Bamford's words, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had become "a sewer of deceit," with Operation
                            Northwoods and other unconscionable escapades to their credit. Then-Undersecretary of State
                            George Ball commented, "There was a feeling that if the destroyer got into some trouble,
                            that this would provide the provocation we needed."<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16"
                                class="footnote">[16]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Here we have two concepts that should be familiar by now: one, the tactic of blaming a
                        nonexistent attack on an enemy and using it as a pretext, and, two, provoking a <em>real
                            attack</em> and using <em>that</em> as a pretext. Although Kissinger disingenuously pins
                        these tactics of manipulation on the puppets who sign off on them, at least he admits they are
                        real. Defending Johnson's deceptive pretext for invading Vietnam, Kissinger informs his readers
                        that FDR did the same thing during WWII:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Neither Johnson's tactics nor his candor was significantly different from Franklin Delano
                            Roosevelt's when he had edged America toward involvement in the Second World War—for
                            example, Roosevelt's not altogether candid account of the torpedoing of the destroyer
                            <em>Greer</em>, the pretext for engaging America in a naval war in the Atlantic…<strong>Both
                                presidents were prepared to put their country's military forces in harm's way and to
                                respond should harm indeed befall them, as was likely. In each case, the ultimate
                                decision to enter the war was based on considerations which went far beyond the
                                immediate incidents.</strong><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Regarding the <em>Greer</em>,<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a> Roosevelt had
                        made a clash "inevitable" when he ordered US ships to report the position of German submarines
                        to the British Navy."<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a> The Greer, on the
                        day it was attacked, had spent hours chasing after and reporting the location of an Axis
                        submarine as the British dropped depth charges from the air. This pursuit continued for nearly
                        three hours and thirty minutes before the sub fired its first torpedo. The <em>Greer</em> then
                        continued its pursuit for another five hours, dropping depth charges of its own, before
                        continuing on its scheduled course.</p>

                    <p>Roosevelt promptly reported the torpedo attack to the public, but he made no mention of the
                        circumstances that preceded it.<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a> Instead,
                        he dishonestly presented the incident as an unprovoked "act of piracy" and used it as a pretext
                        for a radical new "shoot-on-sight" policy. This, in Kissinger's own words, "crossed the line
                        into belligerency." Under this policy, any Axis submarine, whether it attacked a US ship or not,
                        was to be fired on as if it <em>had</em> attacked.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21"
                            class="footnote">[21]</a> Though undeclared and limited, this essentially put America at war
                        against the Axis powers.</p>

                    <p>But <em>limited</em> warfare was never the goal. The Network intended to drag the United States
                        fully into WWII regardless of the American public's desire to remain neutral. And while the
                        attack on the <em>Greer</em> moved US policy and opinion in the "right" direction, the
                        devastating attack on Pearl Harbor sealed the deal.</p>

                    <p>On this topic, Kissinger is a little more cautious about describing FDR's willingness to put US
                        ships and military personnel "in harm's way." For instance, he doesn't mention the McCollum
                        memo, which recommended "an eight-part course of action for the United States to take" in order
                        to provoke Japan into "committing an overt act of war."<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22"
                            class="footnote">[22]</a> However, he does mention a few of the "pressures" (outlined in the
                        McCollum memo) that were placed on Japan prior to the Pearl Harbor attack. Additionally, he
                        hints at the provocation when he says "few understood <em>the nature of the diplomacy</em> that
                        had preceded Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor…It was a measure of the United States' deep seated
                        isolationism that it <strong>had to be bombed at Pearl Harbor</strong> before it would enter the
                        war in the Pacific."<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a></p>

                    <p>FDR's repeated assurances to the American people that the nation would be kept out of the war
                        were nothing more than dual policy. Kissinger praises FDR's cunning when he writes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>America's entry into the war marked the culmination of a great and daring leader's
                            extraordinary diplomatic enterprise. In less than three years, Roosevelt had taken his
                            staunchly isolationist people into a global war…Roosevelt had achieved his goal patiently
                            and inexorably, educating his people one step at a time about the necessities before them…By
                            initiating hostilities, the Axis powers had solved Roosevelt's lingering dilemma about how
                            to move the American people into the war.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24"
                                class="footnote">[24]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Just to be clear, there is some misdirection in Kissinger's statement. It wasn't really
                        <em>FDR</em> who maneuvered the "staunchly isolationist" American people into WWII. That credit
                        more appropriately belongs to the Network. FDR, like every president after Woodrow Wilson,
                        served a power much greater than himself. He was little more than the public face of the
                        Network's global policy.</p>

                    <p>Having covered the pretexts for Vietnam and WWII, this brings us to the "surprise attack" on the
                        passenger liner <em>Lusitania</em> that served as the pretext for US entry into WWI.</p>

                    <h2>Sink the <em>Lusitania</em></h2>

                    <p>Recall from chapter 6 that, just prior to WWI, the Network concluded that war is the most
                        effective way to "alter the life of an entire people." Though the stage for WWI was already set,
                        the staunchly isolationist tendencies of the United States posed a problem. To overcome this
                        problem, the Network set out to gain "control of the State Department" and the "diplomatic
                        machinery" of America. It achieved this by bringing Woodrow Wilson to power in 1913. More
                        accurately, the Network achieved this by bringing Wilson's <em>advisor,</em> Mandell House, to
                        power. As House's biographer notes: "It was House who made the slate for the Cabinet, formulated
                        the first policies of the Administration and <em>practically</em> directed the foreign affairs
                        of the United States."<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote">[25]</a> (If you do a little
                        research into Mandell House, you'll soon realize that the word "practically" does not belong in
                        the preceding sentence.)</p>

                    <p>After all of the right people and instruments were in place (including the Network's two newly
                        created funding mechanisms<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote">[26]</a>), a secret
                        society known as the Black Hand entered the picture. In June 1914 it ordered the assassination
                        of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and, within a month, WWI was underway.<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27"
                            class="footnote">[27]</a> From that point forward, the final steps were clear: maximize the
                        duration and costs of the war, drag the United States into the conflict by whatever means
                        necessary, and then allow the carefully chosen puppet (Wilson) to sell "his" vision for a New
                        World Order.</p>

                    <p>The first problem the Network faced was making sure that the war didn't end too quickly. As early
                        as February 1915, Wilson's talk of "peace" was threatening to end hostilities. Worse, to
                        encourage a dialogue between the warring nations, President Wilson sent Mandell House to London
                        and instructed House to "bear the President's…profound hope that the war could be ended
                        quickly." However, during his trip, House conveyed the exact <em>opposite</em> of the
                        president's sentiments. In his London meeting with Sir Edward Grey, House assured Grey that he
                        had "no intention of pushing the issue of peace"<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28"
                            class="footnote">[28]</a> and, in so doing, intentionally undermined any prospect of
                        mediation. Professor Knock informs us that:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In certain critical instances, "Phillip Dru" seemed to overpower [House]. His statement to
                            Grey hardly reflected Wilson's position. To the contrary, House often expressed unabashedly
                            pro-Allied sentiments…and firmly believed that the basis for future peace lay in an
                            Anglo-American entente. He never accurately informed Wilson about this part of his
                            conversation with Grey; while thus gaining the Foreign Secretary's trust, he obviously did
                            not serve his own chief very well.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote">[29]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>House might have proven himself to Edward Grey (an imperialist Network insider), but this
                        particular diplomatic maneuver was not sufficient to ensure the continuation of hostilities, let
                        alone ensure that the United States would enter the war. For that, the public would have to be
                        manipulated. Some of them might even have to be "put in harm's way." And here is where the
                        British passenger liner <em>Lusitania</em> enters the picture.</p>

                    <p>There isn't enough room to tell the full story here, but suffice to say, the case of the
                        <em>Lusitania</em> was a "damn dirty business."<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30"
                            class="footnote">[30]</a> Consider the following a short summary. For a more thorough
                        account, I highly recommend that you read chapter 12 of <em>The Creature from Jekyll
                            Island</em>.</p>

                    <p>Let's begin with the fact that although the <em>Lusitania</em> was considered a luxury passenger
                        liner, its design specifications were drawn up by the British Admiralty. This enabled the
                        British to easily convert her into a ship of war. In 1913, after adding armor and some other
                        modifications, the British did exactly that. Unbeknownst to her passengers, the ship was then
                        entered into the Admiralty fleet register as an <em>armed auxiliary cruiser</em>. Despite US
                        "neutrality" and the risk to those aboard:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The <em>Lusitania</em> became one of the most important carriers of war materials—including
                            munitions—from the United States to England…On March 8th 1915…the captain of the
                            <em>Lusitania</em> turned in his resignation…he was no longer willing "to carry the
                            responsibility of mixing passengers with munitions."<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31"
                                class="footnote">[31]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Winston Churchill, unlike the captain of the <em>Lusitania</em>, had absolutely no problem mixing
                        passengers with munitions. In fact the careless mixing of passengers, especially
                        <em>American</em> passengers, with war materials could prove very useful politically. For
                        instance, in the event that Germans attacked a "passenger liner" with men, women, and children
                        aboard—<em>American</em> men, women, and children—the beneficial effect on American public
                        opinion would be swift and unanimous. After a handful of stern government condemnations and a
                        well-orchestrated media campaign, it would be easy to shame the isolationists into silence while
                        moving the United States toward entering the war.</p>

                    <p>Much like FDR's policy with the <em>Greer,</em> Churchill's orders (to load munitions onto
                        passenger ships) made a clash at sea inevitable. But this wasn't the only way to provoke a
                        politically useful attack. To increase the likelihood of innocent civilian casualties, Churchill
                        ordered British merchant ships to ram German subs if they attempted to stop and search them for
                        contraband. This made it impossible for Germany to observe the long-established Cruiser Rules.
                        (Under the Cruiser Rules, an unarmed merchant vessel would <em>not</em> be sunk until the crew
                        and passengers were safely evacuated from the ship.) With Churchill's new policy in place,
                        German submarines could no longer come to the surface and were more apt to sink ships without
                        warning. As the following quote from Churchill demonstrates, this was his intention from the
                        start.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The first British countermove, made on my responsibility…was to deter the Germans from
                            surface attack. The submerged U-boat had to rely increasingly on underwater attack and thus
                            <strong>ran the greater risk of mistaking neutral for British ships and of drowning neutral
                                crews and thus embroiling Germany with other Great Powers</strong>.<a href="#fn32"

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>And yet, even these measures proved insufficient to bring about the <em>Lusitania</em>'s demise.
                        It wasn't until the ship was intentionally sent into hostile waters at reduced speed and with
                        her military escort withdrawn that Churchill, and the Network he served, secured their pretext.
                        Griffin writes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In the map room of the British Admiralty, Churchill watched the play unfold and coldly called
                            the shots. Small disks marked the places where two ships had been torpedoed the day before.
                            A circle indicated the area within which the U-boat must still be operating. A larger disk
                            represented the <em>Lusitania</em> travelling at nineteen knots directly into the
                            circle…Commander Joseph Kenworthy, who previously had been called upon by Churchill to
                            submit a paper on what would be the political results of an ocean liner being sunk with
                            American passengers aboard…left the room in disgust.</p>

                        <p>Colonel House was in England at that time and, on the day of the sinking…Sir Edward Grey
                            asked him: "What will America do if the Germans sink an ocean liner with American passengers
                            on board?" As recorded in House's diaries, he replied: "I told him if this were done, a
                            flame of indignation would sweep America, which would in itself probably carry us into the
                            war."…King George also brought up the subject and was even more specific about the possible
                            target. He asked, "Suppose they should sink the <em>Lusitania</em> with American passengers
                            on board…?<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Approximately four hours later, a torpedo sent the <em>Lusitania</em> to the bottom of the ocean.
                        Of its 1,959 passengers, 1,198 lost their lives. Nearly all of the US citizens aboard (128 of
                        139) were killed.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote">[34]</a> Predictably, House
                        immediately seized the opportunity to stoke the "flame of indignation," while cynically
                        appealing to the moral implications of continued US neutrality.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>From England, Colonel House sent a telegram to President Wilson…It became the genesis of
                            thousands of newspaper editorials across the land. He said piously:</p>

                        <p>"America has come to the parting of the ways, when she must determine whether she stands for
                            civilized or uncivilized warfare. We can no longer remain neutral spectators. Our action in
                            this crisis will determine…how far we may influence a settlement for the lasting good of
                            humanity…our position amongst nations is being assessed by mankind."</p>

                        <p>In another telegram two days later, House reveals himself as the master psycho-politician
                            playing on Wilson's ego like a violinist stroking the strings of a Stradivarius. He wrote:
                        </p>

                        <p>"If, unhappily, it is necessary to go to war, I hope you will give the world an exhibition of
                            American efficiency that will be a lesson for a century or more. It is generally believed
                            throughout Europe that we are so unprepared…that our entering would make but little
                            difference…In the event of war, we should accelerate the manufacture of munitions to such an
                            extent that we could supply not only ourselves but the Allies, and so quickly that the world
                            would be astounded."<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote">[35]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Regarding propaganda efforts overseas, Quigley adds:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The propaganda agencies…made full use of the occasion. <em>The Times</em> of London announced
                            that "four-fifths of her passengers were citizens of the United States"…the British
                            <em>manufactured</em> and distributed a medal which they pretended had been awarded to the
                            submarine crew by the German government; a French paper published a picture of the crowds in
                            Berlin at the outbreak of war in 1914 as a picture of Germans "rejoicing" at the news of the
                            sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em>.<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote">[36]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The end of this story holds no surprises. Less than a year later, in cooperation with House and
                        Sir Edward Grey, President Wilson signed off on a scheme<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37"
                            class="footnote">[37]</a> that would drag the United States into World War I. The president
                        did this without the knowledge of the United States Senate and, of course, without the knowledge
                        of the American people. He then proceeded to campaign for his reelection under the slogan "He
                        Kept Us out of the War," patiently waiting until he'd secured his second term before entering
                        World War I in April 1917.</p>

                    <p>The moment Wilson declared war, vast amounts of money began flowing directly into the Network's
                        coffers. Adjusted for inflation, the total cost to the United States from 1917 to 1919 would
                        equal more than $500 billion today. This "war to end all wars" not only buried the United States
                        in debt, it increased the Network's financial leverage in direct proportion to that debt.<a
                            href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote">[38]</a> But there were additional
                        <em>profits</em> as well. Competing empires were destroyed, the isolationist tendencies of the
                        United States were subverted, and the initial framework for a New World Order took shape. None
                        of this happened by chance; each and every step was carefully planned to yield the desired
                        result. And there you see how a handful of false and designing men can manipulate entire nations
                        and alter the history of the world.</p>

                    <h2>A Century of Deception, Theft, and Violence</h2>

                    <p>We've covered an awful lot of ground in the pages of this short book: from the origins of the
                        Network's secret society to its sovereignty-destruction project and "ultimate recovery of the
                        United States of America" in 1913<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote">[39]</a>; from
                        the blatant fraud of its primary funding mechanisms<a href="#fn40" id="fnref40"
                            class="footnote">[40]</a> to its use of ruthless dictators, dual policies, and false-flag
                        operations. What can be said of these men who've achieved so much at the expense of so many?
                        Have they <em>earned</em> the power that they possess? Have we <em>earned</em> the consequences
                        of allowing them to dominate us?</p>

                    <p>The Network believes that the key to controlling the world lies in the application of
                        "<strong><em>secret</em></strong> political and economic influence" and secret control of
                        "journalistic, educational, and propaganda agencies."<a href="#fn41" id="fnref41"
                            class="footnote">[41]</a> Based on their impressive list of global accomplishments, it
                        certainly appears as if they're right. But what happens if their secret "influence" and tactics
                        are exposed for all to see? Could they continue to get away with their crimes? Could they
                        continue to manipulate us into wars, bury us beneath inescapable debt, and con us into
                        surrendering our sovereignty? The answer, by their own estimation, is no. When <em>what</em>
                        they're doing and <em>how</em> they're doing it becomes widely known, the foundation on which
                        their success is built crumbles beneath them.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, this means that the most important work we can do is also the <em>easiest</em>. To
                        the extent we expose the origin and purpose of their instruments, their tried-and-true tactics
                        of manipulation, and their immoral belief that only <em>might</em> determines what's right, we
                        destroy the illusion of legitimacy that they depend on. "So long as we are gaining and spreading
                        awareness, they (by default) are losing power."<a href="#fn42" id="fnref42"
                            class="footnote">[42]</a> This is where we must begin. This is the first step toward
                        destroying their system. So please,</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Reach out to new people regularly and share information that exposes what the Network is and
                            how it operates. When you encounter individuals who either refuse to look at the facts, or
                            who minimize the significance of what's presented, do not take it personally. If they attack
                            you, do not take it personally. In most cases, they are simply defending their world view…it
                            has nothing to do with you. Simply move on and know that every single person that is exposed
                            to this information, even those who initially resist, could become an ally down the road.
                            The same cannot be said of those who are never exposed to the truth.<a href="#fn43"

                            <em>Lusitania</em>. Under pressure, he issued the report that was expected of him but
                            refused compensation and requested that he no longer be called upon to "administer His
                            Majesty's Justice." His final statement on the affair was: "The <em>Lusitania</em> case was
                            a damn dirty business" (as quoted in <em>The Creature from Jekyll Island</em>, page 255). <a

                        <p>[37] From <em>The Creature from Jekyll Island</em>, page 242: "The basic terms of the
                            agreement were that the United States government would offer to negotiate a peaceful
                            settlement between Germany and the Allies…If either side refused to accept the proposal,
                            then the United States would come into the war as an ally of the other side. The catch was
                            that the terms of the proposal were carefully drafted so that Germany could not possibly
                            accept them. Thus, to the world, it would look as though Germany was at fault and the United
                            States was humanitarian." <a href="#fnref37">↩</a></p>

                        <p>[38] Recall from chapter 6: "As payments on mounting debt create greater and greater
                            shortfalls, and as annual spending continues to increase unabated, larger and more frequent
                            loans become necessary to bridge the gap. This accelerates the rate at which the national
                            debt grows and, before long, even powerful nations will find themselves utterly dependent on
                            a constant flow of newly borrowed funds to cover their expenses." The Network is always
                            happy to supply those funds with more debt money that they create out of thin air. <a
