  <h1>CHAPTER SIX<br>Honest Money</h1>
</div>

<div class="Chapter-content">

          <p>The bailout is one way the elite transfer wealth from our hands to theirs. But it is certainly not the only
            way, nor is it the most sophisticated. Perhaps the cleverest scam of all is the actual "money" they've
            created for us to use.</p>

          <p>Just like the fraudulent mechanisms we've outlined in previous chapters, our money has theft built right
            in. By design, it enables wealth to be secretly transferred from those who've earned it to those who create
            and control it.</p>

          <p>Few know the history of money or the many different forms money can take. Some forms of money are more
            prone to fraud than others, and our ignorance of this fact works to the advantage of those running the scam.
            They're more than happy to make us believe only <em>they</em> are smart enough to understand the "complex
            nature of money." Our monetary policy, so they say, is best left to the experts; we should just <em>trust
              them</em>.</p>

          <p>Knowing the ultimate goals of those who created our monetary system, we could hardly make a more dangerous
            mistake.</p>

          <h2>Defining money</h2>

          <p>To accurately define what money is, we can't simply hold up a U.S. dollar or a Russian ruble or a Mexican
            peso and say, "This is money." We're better off to start by defining the overall purpose of money. What does
            money <em>do</em>?</p>

          <p>In the simplest terms, money enables us to purchase products and services from other people. Using this
            basic description, we might go on to say: Money can be anything that is widely accepted as payment for
            products and services<em>.</em></p>

          <p>Having defined money in this way, it will be easier to explain the different forms of money and why some
            are far superior to others. However, before we actually get into the different forms of money, it's a good
            idea to touch on what existed before money. It was known as barter.</p>

          <h2>Barter</h2>

          <p>To "barter" basically means to pay for something you want with products or services instead of paying for
            what you want with money.</p>

          <p>As an example, imagine you grow tomatoes and your neighbor grows corn. It's possible to imagine a scenario
            where you and your neighbor agree to trade 25 pounds of your tomatoes for 25 pounds of his corn. In this
            case, you have each paid for what you want with something other than money.</p>

          <p>Although barter provides an opportunity to engage in trade with others, this type of trade is far more
            limited than what we're used to today. To illustrate: What if your neighbor also grows wheat and you need 25
            pounds of that too? You offer him another 25 pounds of tomatoes, but he declines. (He has no use for any
            more tomatoes.) Now what do you do?</p>

          <p>You might try to find another person who grows wheat and trade with them. Or you might find somebody who
            has something that your wheat-growing neighbor wants, trade your tomatoes for that item, and then trade that
            item for the wheat. But clearly none of these options are as convenient as simply trading your neighbor
            money for his wheat, his corn, or anything else he might be willing to part with. As you can see in this
            example, barter was far from ideal.</p>

          <p>Even though barter was limited in its usefulness, it played a major role in developing the concept of
            money. While trading with each other, people realized certain commodities were always in demand. For
            instance, corn eventually became so high in demand that it could be traded for almost any other product or
            service. From that point forward, corn took on a value that exceeded its consumption value.</p>

          <p>In other words, even though your neighbor already had all the corn he needed for food, he would continue to
            grow or acquire more because he knew the corn would be accepted as payment for the products and services of
            others. The more corn he had, the more purchasing power he had.</p>

          <p>In this way, many different commodities (corn, wheat, animals, etc.) eventually evolved into reliable forms
            of "commodity money."</p>

          <p>Now, with that brief explanation of how barter eventually led to commodity money, let's move on to...</p>

          <h2>Commodity money</h2>

          <p>Cows, sheep, corn, wheat â€” all of these commodities had some intrinsic value, were highly in demand, and,
            as such, people were nearly guaranteed to accept them in trade.</p>

          <p>For this reason, these commodities became some of the earliest forms of commodity money. But just as barter
            was limited, so too was the ability to easily "buy" using indivisible items, like a cow. Perishable food
            items had their limitations as well.</p>

          <p>When mankind discovered metal and learned how to craft it into tools and weapons, the metals themselves
            soon took on the role of commodity money. Metal was superior in many ways. For starters, metal didn't need
            to be fed, watered, and cleaned up after. And, unlike wheat and corn, you didn't have to worry about metal
            going bad, becoming contaminated with bugs or mold, etc.</p>

          <p>Perhaps best of all, metal was easily divisible. Compare the flexibility of purchasing something with iron
            versus purchasing something with a cow: Assuming a cow is equal in value to 100 pounds of iron, and an item
            is for sale valued at 10 pounds of iron (or one-tenth of a cow), the individual buying with iron has a
            distinct advantage. He can easily produce the exact amount of money needed.</p>

          <p>The same cannot be said for the man who is attempting to purchase the item using his cow. Sure, he can
            divide the cow into 10 pieces, but the other nine wouldn't be worth much for very long.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The value of metal ingots was originally determined by weight. Then, as it became customary for the
              merchants who cast them to stamp the uniform weights on the top, they eventually were valued simply by
              counting their number. ... [I]n this form they became, in effect, primitive but functional coins.<a
                href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Just as barter led to the concept of commodity money, and that led to metal becoming the commodity of
            choice, centuries of experimenting with different kinds of metals produced a clear favorite around the
            world: gold.</p>

          <p>Gold's ability to function as a stable form of money is unmatched. (Though silver runs a close second.)
            When it comes to monetary stability, the Federal Reserve System has failed miserably compared to gold and
            silver. But knowing the real aims of those who crafted the system, we shouldn't be surprised.</p>

          <p>Some argue that our modern economy can't use gold as money because "there isn't enough of it to go around."
            But that isn't true. Buyers and sellers will ultimately determine gold's purchasing power based on its
            supply. So, if there are only 10 million ounces of gold circulating in an economy, its purchasing power per
            ounce will be higher than if there are 100 million ounces. This basic economic truth applies to all money,
            regardless of the form it takes.</p>

          <p>Explaining further:</p>

          <p>The more money there is circulating in an economy (whether we're talking corn, sheep, gold, or paper), the
            less purchasing power that money will have.</p>

          <p>For example, if we create a community from scratch and give everyone an equal amount of money, say $10,000
            each, prices for products and services within that community will be set based on the available money
            supply. If instead we give each person $100,000, the same thing will happen; prices will be set based on the
            available money supply. If we give everyone $10 million, it's no different. The fact everyone has $10
            million in our third example will not provide them additional purchasing power. That's because "more money,"
            chasing after the same number of products and services, only bids prices up.</p>

          <p>Knowing this, imagine what happens if somebody starts dramatically inflating/increasing the amount of money
            in circulation?</p>

          <p>If everyone in the community starts with $10,000, prices in the economy will settle based on that money
            supply. But if somebody doubles the money supply a year later (without an increase in newly available
            products and services), the flood of new money will only bid prices up.</p>

          <p>Not long ago, when somebody used the term "inflation," they were referring to the actual act of
            inflating/increasing the money supply. But now the term is almost always used to describe the
            <em>illness</em> that monetary inflation creates (rising prices).
          </p>

          <p>This works out great for those causing the problem. Instead of blaming the real culprits (the people
            printing the money), the public is encouraged to blame the greedy businessmen who "keep raising their
            prices."</p>

          <p>Well, don't be fooled. Your money's purchasing power is being destroyed. As its value decreases, prices
            must rise. It's the same with any currency. (When the value of each monetary unit is driven down, the number
            of monetary units it takes to purchase products and services goes up.)</p>

          <p>I'm getting ahead of the story a little bit, but here is an important point to consider. Imagine for a
            moment you are an unscrupulous (yet highly intelligent) banker who's been given the legal authority to
            control the amount of money in the community that we just mentioned. Can you think of a way you might be
            able to use your inflationary power to your advantage? I'll provide an example.</p>

          <p>Let's say the community begins with a total combined money supply of $50 million. As a banker, you earn
            money by making loans and charging interest on those loans. So, you begin making loans to the community's
            inhabitants.</p>

          <p>Per the current fraudulent banking system, the money for your loans is created out of thin air. They cost
            you nothing. All you've got to do is enter "$100,000" (or whatever the amount may be) into a borrower's
            checking account, and <em>poof</em>: You just created the money for the loan.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, by creating this money for the loan, you also add $100,000 to the total money supply.</p>

          <p>You do this over and over and before long, the community's money supply doubles from $50 million to $100
            million. Soon, the effects of inflating the money supply start to take their toll; prices are rising, people
            who actually saved money prior to the inflation are having "purchasing power" stolen from every dollar they
            earned,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a> and people on fixed incomes are finding it
            increasingly difficult to get by. But <em>you're</em> doing just fine earning interest on the $50 million in
            "loans" that you've put into the community.</p>

          <p>But why stop there? Being the unscrupulous (yet highly intelligent) banker that you are, you have an idea.
            You notice real estate prices have doubled from the inflation. Some might even call the massive rise in
            prices a "bubble."</p>

          <p>You wonder what would happen if you popped that bubble. You wonder what would happen if you began to
            <em>decrease</em> the amount of money in circulation. But you don't <em>really</em> wonder; you know exactly
            what will happen. As the money supply decreases, the purchasing power of each dollar will begin to rise. As
            the money becomes more valuable, prices for products and services will begin to fall.
          </p>

          <p>Specifically, all the real estate prices that had been bid up when there was $100 million in circulation
            will begin to correct downward. Ah, but the mortgages on all those properties aren't going to correct
            downward; no, sir. The people who borrowed $200,000 from you to buy their home when the bubble was at its
            peak will still owe you $200,000. This despite the fact, with the money supply tightening, they'd be lucky
            to sell their home for $150,000. And a couple months from now (caught in the ensuing panic of people trying
            to sell before their home loses more value), they might not be able to sell it for $100,000!</p>

          <p>And that isn't all they've got to worry about. Payments on a $200,000 mortgage were much easier to make
            when hourly wages in the community were based on a total money supply of $100 million. With only $50 million
            to go around, it's becoming nearly impossible to earn enough to keep up with (what are now) ridiculously
            high monthly mortgage payments. And if they are lucky enough to stay employed and earn enough to actually
            pay off their mortgage, their big reward is they'll end up paying double what the home is actually worth.
            Many will have little choice but to give up their homes and try to find another place to live. But is that
            such a bad deal for <em>you</em>, the unscrupulous (but highly intelligent) banker who created the money for
            the loans out of nothing? Probably not.</p>

          <p>Let's see: First, you earned millions in interest payments on "loans" that were made with money created out
            of thin air. Now, you get to seize <strong>real physical assets</strong> (people's homes) because that
            "money" (keystrokes in a computer) wasn't paid back.</p>

          <p>Best of all, those millions in interest payments you earned when people were able to make their payments
            will now buy twice as much in the economy you just crashed. What a great time to go bargain hunting for new
            assets, no? Looks like a win-win-win (or a lose-lose-lose, depending on which side of the game you're on).
          </p>

          <p>Would anyone in their right mind want to give a banker (or bankers) this kind of control over their
            community's money supply? No? OK, then it certainly doesn't make any sense to give that kind of power to a
            banker (or bankers) over our <strong>entire nation's</strong> money supply. But that is exactly what our
            elected officials have done.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency, first by inflation,
              then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all
              property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.</p>
            <p class="quote-attribution">-- attributed to Thomas Jefferson<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"
                class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>It doesn't get any more straightforward than that.</p>

          <p>Returning now to the original point of all this: The argument against gold (that there isn't enough to go
            around) is fraudulent. The real reason our banker friends don't want an honest monetary system (one that
            prevents them from creating limitless piles of money out of nothing) is because of what it would do to their
            wealth and power.</p>

          <p>When they insist our modern economic system requires an elastic money supply to function properly
            ("elastic" meaning they can inflate or deflate as much as they like), they are actually telling us the
            truth. That is, our modern economic reality of endless bubbles and bursts, steady inflation, bailouts,
            inescapable debt, and the covert transfer of wealth from our hands to the hands of others really does
            require the system they've created to function properly.</p>

          <p>The problem is our modern system is unacceptable. It wasn't created to serve our needs; it was created to
            serve the needs of those who lied it into existence.</p>

          <p>On the issue of <em>needing</em> an elastic money supply, professor of economics Murray Rothbard writes:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>There is no need whatever for any planned increase in the money supply, for the supply to rise to offset
              any condition, or to follow any artificial criteria. More money does not supply more capital, is not more
              productive, does not permit "economic growth."<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The idea of making money more elastic isn't new. Even under the discipline of a gold coin monetary system,
            unscrupulous individuals figured out how to inflate the money supply. By shaving off a small portion of each
            gold coin that passed through their hands, merchants and kings were able to amass piles of gold shavings,
            which were then melted down and cast into new coins.</p>

          <p>By now, you can surely predict how this affected the economy. Those who created the money would spend it at
            full value, and as the newly created coins began to inflate the existing money supply (driving down the
            value of existing coins), the number of coins it took to purchase products and services went up.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>As governments became more brazen in their debasement of the currency, <strong>even to the extent of
                diluting the gold or silver content,</strong> the population adapted quite well by simply "discounting"
              the new coins. That is to say, they accepted them at a realistic value, which was lower than what the
              government had intended. This was, as always, reflected in a general rise in prices. ... Governments don't
              like to be thwarted in their plans to exploit their subjects. So a way had to be found to <em>force</em>
              people to accept these slugs as real money. <strong>This led to the first legal-tender laws.</strong> By
              royal decree, the "coin of the realm" was declared legal for the settlement of all debts. Anyone who
              refused it at face value was subject to fine, imprisonment, or, in some cases, even death.<a href="#fn5"
                id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The king's legal tender laws forced individuals to accept coins that they would have otherwise rejected or,
            at the very least, discounted heavily.</p>

          <p>As an example, imagine an economy where all trade is conducted using gold coins. Suddenly, the king decides
            to start minting coins made of wood. By "royal decree," he demands his new one-ounce wooden coins be
            accepted at the same rate as one ounce of gold. He declares them legal tender. What would the people do?</p>

          <p>Well, there is no need to guess. We can simply look at what citizens actually did do in response to the
            first legal tender laws. They began hoarding their truly valuable gold coins. After all, if you were forced
            to accept junk coins as payment, would you (out of the kindness of your heart) continue making your payments
            in gold?</p>

          <p>The same thing happened in America in the 1960s when silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars were replaced
            with new coins made out of a mixture of copper and nickel. Within months, a good percentage of the silver
            coins had already been stashed away. Sure, the new "cupronickel" quarters <em>said</em> they were worth the
            same as the old quarters (25 cents), but that didn't mean they really were.</p>

          <p>To put it in perspective, a roll of 40 quarters has a stamped face value of $10.00 whether the quarters are
            made out of silver or the cupronickel of today. However, the real value of a roll of silver quarters (based
            on the weight of the silver alone) is currently over $165.00<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"
              class="footnote">[6]</a> So, which would you rather have? Would you trade a $165.00 roll of silver
            quarters for a $10.00 roll of cupronickel quarters?</p>

          <p>Of course, today our rulers have more sophisticated ways to debase our currency. Rather than shaving coins
            or replacing solid coins with "plated coins" or intentionally diluting the purity of the gold or silver
            content, they instead achieve what they want through our modern banking system.</p>

          <p>Alan Greenspan spoke out against the consequences of this practice in 1966. Ironically, about 20 years
            later, he was elected chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve! "Even the wisest of men can
            be corrupted by power and wealth."<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a> Nevertheless, in
            1966, Mr. Greenspan laid out the truth in no uncertain terms. He wrote:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system
              as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit. ...</p>

            <p>The law of supply and demand is not to be conned. As the supply of money ... increases relative to the
              supply of tangible assets in the economy, prices must eventually rise. Thus, the earnings saved by the
              productive members of the society lose value[.] ...</p>

            <p>In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through
              inflation. ... Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the "hidden" confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in
              the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.<a href="#fn8"
                id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>And on that note, even if gold isn't the absolute perfect choice for our monetary system, it surely beats
            the blatant fraud and exploitation inherent in the system we have today.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9"
              class="footnote">[9]</a></p>

          <p>So far, we've seen how trade first began as barter, and from barter came the discovery that certain
            commodities were always in demand. Those commodities (sheep, wheat, corn, etc.) became the first form of
            commodity money, widely accepted as payment for other products and services. Commodity money evolved,
            eventually leading to the use of metal coins and then finally to the use of gold and silver as the most
            widely sought and accepted coins.</p>

          <p>But these coins also had their limitations. First, they were heavy. Today, we take for granted that we can
            carry $1,000 in paper money as easily as we can carry $1. This wasn't the case in a silver or gold coin
            economy where $1,000 worth of coins weighed 1,000 times more than $1 worth.</p>

          <p>Also, lugging a large quantity of gold or silver coins around wasn't safe, and trying to find a truly
            secure hiding place to store your coins wasn't much fun either.</p>

          <p>Eventually, receipt money emerged as the solution to these problems. Like the other forms of money
            mentioned in this chapter, receipt money (in its original form), provides an example of
            <strong>honest</strong> money. Here is how it came into being.
          </p>

          <h2>Receipt money is born</h2>

          <p>Goldsmiths handled large stockpiles of gold and silver in their trade. Logically, they needed a safe place
            to store those stockpiles, and for this purpose, they built very strong and well-guarded vaults.</p>

          <p>Citizens eventually figured out there was no need to worry about hiding their own coins because, for a
            small fee, they could simply store them in the goldsmith's vault. The goldsmiths happily agreed to the
            arrangement as it was a way to earn some easy extra money.</p>

          <p>As a citizen renting space in the goldsmith's vault, you would take in your supply of gold coins, say
            $1,000 worth, and you would be given a receipt as proof of your deposit. The receipt would state the value
            of the gold coins you'd deposited (in this case $1,000), and it would be stamped "payable on demand." This
            meant whenever you decided to present the receipt to the goldsmith, he was required to take it from you and,
            in exchange, give you back $1,000 worth of gold.</p>

          <p>However, it was rare for people to withdraw their gold. (They would just need to find another place to
            store it if they did.) Instead, most just continued making deposits and collecting receipts as proof of each
            deposit they'd made.</p>

          <p>Soon enough, everyone was walking around with these paper receipts in their pockets. Because the paper
            receipts literally were "good as gold," people began using the receipts to purchase products and services.
            As an example, if you wanted to purchase an item for $1,000, rather than go to the goldsmith to withdraw
            your gold coins, you'd simply give the seller your $1,000 receipt. This not only made it easier on you; but
            it was easier on the seller too. (If you had paid in gold coins, chances are the seller would have just
            taken the coins right back to the goldsmith for safe storage.)</p>

          <p>This paper receipt money (100% backed by gold) was a huge improvement in the evolution of money. And it
            improved even further when different denominations of receipts were made available at the time of deposit.
          </p>

          <p>For instance, if you brought $1,000 worth of coins to the goldsmith, you could now ask for ten $100
            receipts or twenty $50 receipts, etc. instead of just a single $1,000 receipt. This of course led to the
            receipts themselves being exchanged for different denominations. (If you had a $100 receipt, you could
            easily exchange it for ten $10 receipts, so on and so forth.)</p>

          <p>It was honest <em>paper money</em> at its best. But it didn't last long.</p>

            <p>[2] If you have saved $100, and a loaf of bread costs $1, it's easy to calculate that you can afford to
              buy 100 loaves of bread. However, if inflation drives the cost of bread up to $2 per loaf, that $100 that
              you've saved will now only buy half as much bread. (The <em>purchasing power</em> of your savings has been
              cut in half.) The end result of this price inflation, regarding what you "have the money to buy," is no
              different than if somebody stole $50 of your savings. <a href="#fnref2">â†©</a></p>

            <p>[3] This quote is often attributed to Thomas Jefferson, but it appears to be a paraphrase. For instance,
              the following quote conveys nearly the exact same sentiment, only it's not written in laymen's terms: "The
              plethory of circulating medium which raised the prices of everything to several times their ordinary and
              standard value, in which state ... heavy debts were contracted; and the sudden withdrawing too great a
              proportion of that medium, and reduction of prices far below that standard, constitutes the disease under
              which we are now laboring. [... ] Certainly no nation ever before abandoned to the avarice [... ] of
              private individuals to regulate, according to their own interests, the quantum of circulating medium for
              the nation, to inflate, by deluges of paper, the nominal prices of property, and then to buy up that
              property ... having first withdrawn the floating medium which might endanger a competition in purchase.
              Yet this is what has been done, and will be done, unless stayed by the protecting hand of the legislature.
              The evil has been produced by the error of their sanction of this ruinous machinery of banks; and justice,
              wisdom, duty, all require that they should interpose and arrest it before the schemes of plunder and
              spoliation desolate the country." -- "The Works of Thomas Jefferson," Volume 12 (Correspondence and papers
              1816 - 1826) in a letter to William C. Rives <a href="#fnref3">â†©</a></p>

            <p>[9] 2024 update: As noted in Chapter 0, a decentralized / rules-based-digital alternative to gold (like
              Bitcoin) is also an option. Bitcoin, like gold, is decentralized, difficult to create, divisible, durable
              (exists on an immutable blockchain), and is accepted as payment for products and services around the
              world. It doesn't have "intrinsic value" in the same way as gold, but neither did rocks, sticks, feathers,
              and other items that have served as money. <a href="#fnref9">â†©</a></p>
