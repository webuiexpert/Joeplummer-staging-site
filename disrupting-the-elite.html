                <p class="editor-note">
                    Editor's note: This text was added to the end of Chapter 5 of the second edition of
                    <a href="http://amzn.to/2fNmReD" target="_blank">Tragedy and Hope 101, now available here.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the past 100 years, the Network has worked very hard to monopolize our money, media, medicine,
                    manufacturing, education, energy, agriculture, and government. But all of this top-down centralized
                    power is
                    currently under attack. It's being destroyed—not by armies, but by innovation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of now, the most obvious and widespread example of this monopoly-destroying power is the
                    internet.
                    Although the Network can still use its legacy-media empire to spread lies, the internet has
                    dramatically
                    shortened the lifecycle of those lies. Also, thanks to the internet, the Network has lost its
                    ability to
                    stop whistleblowers, hackers, and ordinary citizens from exposing its crimes. (Before, it could
                    simply
                    refuse to distribute the evidence against it. Today, we can distribute the evidence
                    ourselves—instantly and
                    at nearly zero cost.) In all of human history, rulers have never faced a threat of this magnitude,
                    and it's
                    only just beginning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are now entering an era of technological development that many believe will lead to "exponential
                    disruption." All of the aforementioned choke points of control—from energy to education, medicine to
                    manufacturing, agriculture to government—will change dramatically in the next 20 to 30 years. The
                    most
                    beneficial characteristic of these technology-driven changes is that they, like the internet, will
                    decentralize and redistribute power. They will weaken, and then replace, the immoral and inadequate
                    centralized systems that our rulers have created.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Simply stated: to disrupt the elite, we must continue decentralizing everything they have
                    monopolized. We
                    must build the competing/parallel systems that will eventually render their current systems
                    irrelevant. And
                    here is where the issue of "raising awareness" really shows its importance. For every one million
                    people
                    that "wake up," a small number will fully apply their talents (in their areas of expertise) toward
                    creating
                    solutions. As more join the fight, more solutions will emerge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Equally important are the millions who are "awake" but aren't actively developing solutions. Why?
                    Because
                    they will provide the vital base of early adopters; they will be the ones who support the emerging
                    alternatives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By the time 10 to 15 percent of the adult population begins to support and apply the tactics
                    outlined in
                    this chapter, the Network's continued illegitimate control will become unmanageable. But this army
                    of
                    informed and engaged citizens isn't going to magically appear. We have to make it happen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And as we're making it happen, those who currently hold power will attack our efforts with every lie
                    and
                    dirty trick in the book; but that doesn't matter. If we intend to take back what "false and
                    designing
                    men"<span class="footnote-ref">24</span> have stolen, we must be prepared to demand it. If we hope
                    to achieve our ends via
                    nonviolent means, the time to act is now… and if a violent confrontation proves unavoidable, we can
                    rest
                    assured that the nonviolent work we have done will provide the foundation for our success.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To clarify the importance of resistance, I will cover the incredible lawlessness and immorality of
                    those
                    we're up against in the final chapters. Rather than focus on how they might abuse their power, I'll
                    focus on
                    how they already have.
                </p>

                        <strong>24</strong> This is a reference to a famous quote by Samuel Adams. It reads, in part:
                        <em>"The liberties of our Country, the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending at
                            all hazards:
                            And it is our duty to defend them against all attacks… It will bring an everlasting mark of
                            infamy on the
                            present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by
                            violence
                            without a struggle; or be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and designing men.
                            Of the latter
                            we are in most danger at present…"</em>
