                        <p>Richard Lynn is a prominent psychologist whose research on human intelligence is often cited
                            in articles
                            like

                            mention that
                            Richard Lynn is also a hardcore eugenicist.</p>

                        <p>In his book <a href="http://amzn.to/1HGOzkq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Eugenics: A
                                    Reassessment</strong></a>, Lynn argues that governments have the authority to
                            sterilize their
                            citizens if they consider those citizens "undesirable." He uses words like "retarded,
                            psychopathic, and
                            criminal" to describe the prime targets of compulsory sterilization, but his definition of
                            these words
                            would surprise most people. For instance, if you speed in your car, dislike paying taxes, or
                            became a
                            parent in your teens, you're probably a psychopath. (See pages 117–118.) This might explain
                            why, when
                            the U.S. government forcibly sterilized sixty thousand citizens, Lynn claimed that the U.S.
                            should have
                            sterilized sixty million. (See page 42.)</p>

                        <p>Men like Lynn worship political power and despise individual rights. They believe that an
                            authoritarian
                            global government, based on eugenics, is both inevitable and desirable. (They imagine they
                            will be among
                            the elite in such a society; they imagine they have nothing to fear.) Since it's almost
                            impossible to
                            describe the extent of their arrogance, I've transcribed most of my highlighted references

                <p><span class="page-ref">VII:</span> Eugenics should not have been rejected:</p>

                <p>"During the course of the twentieth century a profound change took place in scientific and public
                    attitudes to
                    eugenics. In the first half of the century, virtually all biological scientists and most social
                    scientists
                    supported eugenics and so did many of the informed public….in the last three decades of the century,
                    eugenics
                    became almost universally rejected. …there is nothing particularly unusual in the rejection of a
                    scientific
                    theory…What is unusual is the rejection of a theory that is essentially correct…this is what
                    occurred in the
                    twentieth century with regard to eugenics."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">VII - VIII:</span> The eight core propositions of eugenics:</p>

                <p>"1. Certain human qualities are valuable. The most important of these are health, intelligence, and
                    what was
                    described by eugenicists as 'moral character,' which consists of a well-developed moral sense,
                    self-discipline,
                    strong work motivation, and social concern."</p>

                <div class="comment">
                    <p>(Of course the "moral character" of those who'd like to control the world and breed / exterminate
                        humans like
                        animals is never questioned.)</p>
                </div>

                <p>"2. These human qualities are valuable because they provide the foundation for a nation's
                    intellectual and
                    cultural achievements; its quality of life and its economic, scientific, and military strength.</p>

                <p>3. Health, intelligence, and moral character are to a substantial extent genetically determined.
                    Hence it would
                    be possible to improve these qualities genetically. This would produce an improvement of what can be
                    described
                    as the 'genetic human capital" of the population. This is the objective of eugenics…</p>

                <p>4. During the second half of the nineteenth century and throughout the twentieth century, the
                    populations of the
                    Western democracies and most of the rest of the world have been deteriorating genetically with
                    respect to the
                    three qualities of health, intelligence, and moral character. This process is known as dysgenics and
                    poses a
                    threat to the quality of civilization and culture and to the economic, scientific, and military
                    strength of the
                    nation state. The first objective of eugenics is to arrest and to reverse this process.</p>

                <p>5. It would be feasible to improve the genetic quality of the population with respect to its health,
                    intelligence, and moral character. There are two broad kinds of program by which this could be
                    accomplished.
                    These can be designated 'classical eugenics' and 'the new eugenics.' <em>Classical eugenics</em>
                    consists of the
                    application to humans of the methods used for many centuries by plant and animal breeders to produce
                    plants and
                    livestock of better quality by breeding from the better specimens. The application of such a
                    selective breeding
                    program to human populations would require policies for 'positive eugenics,' designed to increase
                    the numbers of
                    children of the healthy, the intelligent, and those with strong moral character; and for 'negative
                    eugenics,'
                    designed to reduce the numbers of children of the unhealthy and of those with low intelligence and
                    weak moral
                    character.</p>

                <p>6. The <em>new eugenics</em> consists of the use of human biotechnology to achieve eugenic
                    objectives. The
                    techniques of human biotechnology comprise artificial insemination by donor (AID), prenatal
                    diagnosis of genetic
                    diseases and disorders, in vitro fertilization and preimplantation diagnosis, cloning, and genetic
                    engineering
                    by the implantation of new genes.</p>

                <p>7. Eugenics serves the needs of individuals and of nation states. It serves the needs of individuals
                    because
                    people like to have children who are healthy and intelligent and of good moral character. It serves
                    the needs of
                    the nation state because a nation state whose population has good health, high intelligence, and
                    good moral
                    character is stronger and more likely to succeed in competition with other nation states.</p>

                <p>8. Although there has been much discussion in the Western democracies about whether the
                    biotechnologies of embryo
                    selection, cloning, and the like are ethical and should be permitted, the prohibition of them will
                    not be
                    successful. No new technologies that serve human needs have ever been successfully suppressed. The
                    important
                    question about eugenics is not if it should be allowed, but where it will be developed and how to
                    counter the
                    threat this will present to the Western democracies."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">IX:</span> Eugenics will be used to develop a "world state"</p>

                <p>"[Eugenics] is likely to be used for the development of national strength by authoritarian states,
                    leading
                    ultimately to the establishment of a world state."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">1-2:</span> Plato imagines a eugenic utopia + Francis Galton:</p>

                <p>"Eugenics was first advanced by the Greek philosopher Plato in his book <em>The Republic</em>,
                    written about 380
                    B.C. This book was a blueprint for a utopian state. The state would consist of three classes of
                    rulers or
                    'guardians,' soldiers, and workers, each of which would be bred from the best individuals using the
                    methodology
                    of the selective breeding of livestock, which was well known in Athens in the fourth century B.C…
                </p>

                <p>In modern times, eugenics was founded by the English statistician, biologist, psychologist, and
                    polymath Sir
                    Francis Galton (1820 – 1911), who coined the word <em>eugenics</em> and set out its basic
                    principles…the word
                    being constructed from the Greek to mean 'good breeding'…Galton, in 1883, wrote, 'We greatly want a
                    brief word
                    to express the science of improving stock which takes cognizance of all influences that tend in
                    however remote a
                    degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily
                    over the less
                    suitable than they would otherwise have had. The word <em>eugenics</em> would sufficiently express
                    the
                    idea…Eugenics was to be the study of agencies under social control that may improve or repair the
                    racial
                    qualities of future generations, either physically or mentally.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">5-6:</span> Galton tests his genetic theories + adopted sons don't do as well:
                </p>

                <p>"First [Galton] constructed a number of family pedigrees of eminent men including lawyers, statesmen,
                    scientists,
                    writers, musicians, Cambridge scholars, and to cover physical capacities, wrestlers. He showed that
                    eminence in
                    these fields tends to run in families and is more likely to present among close relatives than among
                    those who
                    are more distant…[The percentages were] all high when compared with the presence of eminence in the
                    general
                    population…Hence Galton concluded that eminence is disproportionately represented in certain
                    families. He argued
                    that this, together with the greater frequency of eminence among close relatives as compared with
                    more distant
                    relatives, indicated genetic transmission.</p>

                <p>Galton was aware of the possible objection that close relatives of eminent men would have
                    environmental
                    advantages that might explain these achievements. His second argument for evidence of a genetic
                    basis for
                    eminence was designed to counter this objection. The argument consisted of an examination of the
                    lives of a
                    number of the adopted sons of popes and showed that these did not achieve eminence to the same
                    extent as the
                    biological sons of eminent men…</p>

                <p>Galton's third argument for a genetic basis for ability was that there are a number of exceptions to
                    the general
                    rule that high ability tends to run in families. He noted that quite frequently very gifted
                    individuals have
                    come from quite ordinary families…</p>

                <p>Thus Galton demonstrated that achievement has a high heritability, as shown by its transmission in
                    elite families
                    and by its spontaneous appearance in ordinary families, and he argued that this implies that the
                    underlying
                    components of achievement must also have high heritability."</p>

                <div class="comment">
                    <p>(This isn't a very sound argument. If you're claiming that "achievement" is determined by the
                        inherited
                        attributes of intelligence and character, how do you then state that "very gifted individuals,
                        quite
                        frequently" come from ordinary families? How do you suggest that these desirable characteristics
                        are clearly
                        a matter of superior genetics – passed on by superior parents – but then say: "except for when
                        there is a
                        <em>spontaneous appearance</em>?" More importantly, in the ideal eugenicist state, wouldn't
                        "ordinary"
                        parents be prevented from having children? …How many "very gifted" individuals would have never
                        been born
                        under such conditions?)

                <p><span class="page-ref">7:</span> Dysgenics:</p>

                <p>"Galton believed that the population of Britain and other Western nations had begun to deteriorate
                    genetically.
                    He was one of the first to understand the phenomenon, which was later to become known as dysgenics…
                    'One of the
                    effects of civilization is to diminish the rigor of the application of the law of natural selection.
                    It
                    preserves weakly lives that would have perished in more barbarous lands.'</p>

                <p>Four years later…Galton discussed a second way in which natural selection had broken down. This was
                    the emergence
                    of an inverse relationship between ability and fertility; that is to say, the more talented members
                    of the
                    population were having fewer children than the less talented. He argued that in the first stages of
                    civilization, 'the more able and enterprising men' tended to have large numbers of children, but
                    that as
                    civilization matured, these began to have fewer children than the less able and enterprising.'"</p>

                <p>"Forty years later, in one of his last papers written shortly before his death, he reiterated that
                    'it seems to
                    be a tendency of high civilization to check fertility in the upper classes…'</p>

                <p>The less fit were increasing in numbers through the reduction of their previous high mortality and
                    through an
                    increase in their fertility…Because natural selection was failing to keep human populations fit, it
                    would be
                    necessary, Galton wrote in his <em>Memories</em> shortly before his death, 'to replace natural
                    selection by
                    other processes.' The formulation and implementation of these processes was the objective of
                    eugenics...</p>

                <p>Galton was always conscious that proposals not only must be effective genetically, but also had to be
                    acceptable
                    to public opinion."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">10:</span> Decrease the fertility of the undesirables / negative eugenics:</p>

                <p>"[Galton] suggested that it would be useful to distinguish three broad classes of individuals in the
                    population:
                    the 'desirables,' the 'passables,' and the 'undesirables.' The 'desirables' would be those who had
                    an
                    exceptional endowment of worth, consisting of health, intelligence, and character. The 'passables'
                    would be
                    those who had average endowment of these qualities. The 'undesirables' would be those in which these
                    qualities
                    were poor. He thought the best strategy for practical eugenics would be to attempt to increase the
                    fertility of
                    the desirables, and he proposed the term <em>positive eugenics</em> for policies designed to achieve
                    this. At
                    the same time, attempts should be made to discourage the fertility of the undesirables, which he
                    designated
                    <em>negative eugenics.</em> No action should be taken on the passables."

                <p>"Positive eugenics was to consist of measures to encourage the procreation of the small elite of
                    desirables.
                    Galton made two proposals to advance this objective. The first was for the establishment of local
                    eugenics
                    associations, which would be staffed by eugenics enthusiasts to promote eugenic principles and
                    policies in their
                    localities."</p>

                <p>"Galton's second proposal for positive eugenics was that the desirable elite should be made conscious
                    of their
                    ethical duty to have children and thereby increase, or at least maintain, their numbers in future
                    generations.
                    To develop this consciousness, he proposed that families that had made valuable social contributions
                    over
                    several generations by virtue of their qualities of good health, abilities, and character should be
                    identified,
                    thus fostering their consciousness of being a genetic elite. Galton first floated the idea in 1883
                    when he
                    wrote, 'My object is to build up by extensive inquiry and publication of results, a sentiment of
                    caste among
                    those who are naturally gifted.' Some 20 years later he returned to this proposal in a lecture…He
                    announced on
                    this occasion that he was funding a research fellowship at University College, London, to undertake
                    the task of
                    compiling pedigrees of elite families."</p>

                <p>"[Galton] doubted whether the undesirables could be induced to curtail their fertility by moral
                    persuasion.
                    Therefore, he believed that some kind of coercion would be required, writing that 'stern compulsion
                    ought to be
                    exerted to prevent the free propagation of the stock of those who are seriously afflicted by lunacy,
                    feeble-mindedness, habitual criminality, and pauperism.' He was confident that 'our democracy will
                    ultimately
                    refuse consent to that liberty of propagating children which is now allowed to the undesirable
                    classes,' but he
                    did not specify the details of how this would be achieved. In the twentieth century, this prediction
                    was
                    realized by the sterilization laws that were widely implemented in many Western nations."</p>

                    self-perpetuating
                    oligarchy, licenses for childbearing determined by your <em>grade</em>:</p>

                <p>"Throughout most of his life, Galton considered it best to set out the principles of eugenics in
                    general terms
                    and was reluctant to propose a detailed policy program, which he thought would be likely to
                    antagonize public
                    opinion. Nevertheless, he departed from this principle in the last two years of his life, during
                    which he wrote
                    an account of a eugenic utopia. This was an imaginary republic that he called Kantsaywhere. He
                    completed the
                    manuscript in 1910…</p>

                <p>Kantsaywhere is a small country of some ten thousand inhabitants. It is governed by the Eugenic
                    College, which
                    elects a Council to carry out the legislative and the executive functions of government…However,
                    whereas the
                    members of the British House of Commons are elected by the population in accordance with the
                    principles of
                    democracy, the members of the Eugenic College in Kantsaywhere are recruited by examination…The
                    selection
                    procedure ensures that the ruling elite in Kantsaywhere is a self-perpetuating oligarchy.</p>

                <p>One of the functions of the Eugenic College is to preserve and enhance the genetic quality of the
                    population. It
                    does this by issuing licenses for parenthood. Couples wishing to have children are required to apply
                    for a
                    license to do so, and to obtain this they have to take an examination…The marks obtained by the
                    couples are
                    summed, and on the basis of the total they are classified into five grades…Those in grade one, the
                    top grade,
                    are permitted to have as many children as they wish; those in grade two are allowed to have three
                    children;
                    those in grade three may have two children; those in grade four are allowed one; while those in
                    grade five, the
                    bottom grade, are not allowed to have any children."</p>

                <div class="comment">
                    <p>(Under this scheme, everyone in grade 5 would be eliminated from the gene pool within one
                        generation; grade 4
                        would be eliminated shortly thereafter due to a lack of replacement-level fertility and grade 3
                        would likely
                        suffer the same fate, albeit more slowly. ...Now, imagine if someone in grade 1 or 2 had the
                        courage to
                        question the wisdom or equity of this system; the threat of <em>reclassification</em> would go a
                        long way
                        toward silencing criticism of the "self-perpetuating oligarchy.")</p>
                </div>

                <p>"Opinion surveys carried out in the second half of the twentieth century have shown that in the
                    economically
                    developed world, the great majority of people would like to have two children; so individuals in
                    grades four and
                    five would have their reproductive rights severely restricted. This restriction raises the problem
                    of how it
                    could be enforced. Galton proposed that couples who exceeded the permitted number of children would
                    be punished
                    by fines, long-term imprisonment, or deportation. It is doubtful whether the punishments would work
                    effectively
                    to deter childbearing among many of these couples because the couples in question would be those
                    with low
                    intelligence and conscientiousness, precisely the people for whom the prospect of punishment has
                    little
                    deterrent effect. If they were fined, many of them would probably not be able to pay and would have
                    more
                    children. Permanent incarceration in prisons or deportation would certainly prevent further
                    transgressions, but
                    these penalties would not be practical alternatives for what would probably be large numbers of
                    offenders. A
                    further problem with the scheme lies in securing the consent of the population in a democratic
                    society. There
                    can be little doubt that this would not be possible and that such a scheme could only be introduced
                    in an
                    authoritarian state…</p>

                <p>Kantsaywhere is…not a democracy but an oligarchy run by a genetic elite. It is not difficult to see
                    why Galton
                    envisaged Kantsaywhere as an oligarchy. He must have come to the conclusion that his eugenic state
                    would have to
                    exert so much coercion on its citizens in the form of restricting the childbearing of some and
                    increasing the
                    childbearing of others that it would not be viable as a democracy."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">17:</span> Society is more important than individuals:</p>

                <p>"Galton believed that eugenics would promote the interests of both individuals and society as a
                    whole: 'eugenics
                    covers for both.' Nevertheless, the principal objective of eugenics is to strengthen societies
                    rather than to
                    advance the well-being of individuals because, as he wrote at the conclusion of his
                    <em>Memories,</em>
                    'individuals appear to me as detachments from the infinite ocean of being.'"</p>

                <p>"Francis Galton's ideas on eugenics won considerable acceptance in the late nineteenth century and in
                    the early
                    and middle decades of the twentieth century. The majority of biologists, geneticists, and social
                    scientists and
                    many informed laypeople, accepted Galton's arguments that the quality of civilization and national
                    strength
                    depended on the genetic quality of the population, that natural selection was no longer operating to
                    keep the
                    quality of the population sound in contemporary populations, and that eugenic policies were needed
                    to counteract
                    this deterioration…By the middle decades of the twentieth century, eugenics had become widely
                    accepted
                    throughout the whole of the economically developed world, with the exception of the Soviet Union
                    where genetics
                    was proscribed for ideological reasons…</p>

                <p>Darwin spoke pessimistically about the large number of children being produced by 'the scum' and was
                    'very gloomy
                    on the future of humanity, on the ground that in our modern civilization, natural selection had no
                    place and the

                    subscribed in
                    varying degrees to eugenics. Among the biologists and geneticists, the foremost of these were Sir
                    Ronald Fisher,
                    Sir Julian Huxley (brother of <em>Brave New World</em> author, Aldous Huxley), Sir Peter Medawar,
                    J.B.S.
                    Haldane, and Francis Crick…Fisher discussed the breakdown of natural selection and the onset of
                    genetic
                    deterioration in his book <em>The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</em>…Fisher argued that
                    centuries of
                    social mobility had led to a concentration of the genes for intelligence and moral character in the
                    highest
                    social classes and hence that their low fertility must entail genetic deterioration. He suggested
                    that dysgenic
                    fertility appears in all mature civilizations, giving as examples ancient Greece and Rome and Islam,
                    and argued

                    from 1959-62…He envisaged that eugenics would in due course become universally accepted and that

                    of all
                    cognitive tests. Spearman was a member of the British Eugenics Society, and in 1912 he wrote a paper
                    in which he
                    proposed that only those individuals who scored reasonably highly on <em>g</em> should be permitted
                    to vote and
                    to have children.</p>

                <p>"Cyril Burt (1883 – 1971) was also professor of psychology at University College, London. He carried
                    out one of
                    the first studies on the heritability of intelligence, in which he collected a set of identical
                    twins who were
                    separated shortly after birth and were reared in different families. He found they were closely
                    similar for
                    intelligence…Burt also did some of the early work on the calculation of the rate of decline of
                    intelligence in
                    Britain. He collected data on the tendency of the intelligence of children to fall with increasing
                    family size,
                    from which he inferred that parents with low IQs were having large numbers of children and from
                    which he
                    calculated that the mean IQ in Britain was declining at a rate of approximately two IQ points a
                    generation.</p>

                <p>Sir Godfrey Thomson...also worked on the decline of intelligence in Britain…and reached the same
                    conclusions as
                    Burt on the rate of deterioration.</p>

                <p>Raymond Cattell also collected data on the association between the intelligence of children and the
                    numbers of
                    their siblings and also found that it was significantly negative. He estimated that the
                    deterioration of the
                    national intelligence was 3.2 IQ points per generation."</p>

                <p>"Eugenics was taken up in the United States in the first decade of the twentieth century. In 1906,
                    the American
                    Breeders' Association, renamed the American Genetics Association in 1913, set up a Committee on
                    Eugenics to
                    promote work on the concept; and in 1910 the Eugenics Record Office was established at Cold Spring
                    Harbor on
                    Long Island, New York, as a center for eugenic research and publication. The American Eugenics
                    Society was
                    formed in 1923. Many prominent American biological and social scientists subscribed to eugenics in
                    the early
                    middle decades of the twentieth century. Biologists included Charles Davenport, Harry Laughlin,
                    Hermann Muller,
                    Linus Pauling, and Joshua Lederberg.</p>

                <p>Charles Davenport was a geneticist and was the first director of the Eugenics Record Office, where he
                    carried out
                    early research on the action of dominant and recessive genes in humans. His book <em>Heredity in
                        Relation to
                        Eugenics</em> was the first major statement of the case for eugenics to be made in the United
                    States. In
                    1910 Davenport invited Harry Laughlin to become superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office at Cold
                    Spring
                    Harbor. Laughlin…was responsible for drafting and promoting a number of the sterilization laws
                    introduced in a
                    number of U.S. states from the time of World War I onward.</p>

                <p>Herman Muller (1890 – 1967) was one of the foremost geneticists of the middle decades of the
                    twentieth century.
                    His principal work was on the effect of X rays on increasing the number of genetic mutations, for
                    which he was
                    awarded the Nobel Prize. Muller believed the rate of mutations was increasing in industrial
                    societies as a
                    result of a variety of pollutants, such as the use of pesticides on crops. He argued that as most
                    mutations are
                    harmful, this was increasing the number of adverse genes and was having a dysgenic effect. He was
                    also concerned
                    about dysgenic fertility in respect to intelligence and character qualities, and proposed the
                    establishment of
                    an elite semen bank, which women would be encouraged to use to produce genetically superior
                    children. Muller
                    drew up 'The Geneticists' Manifesto,' which addressed the issue of how the world's population might
                    be improved
                    genetically…The manifesto was signed by a number of leading geneticists of the time, including
                    J.B.S. Haldane
                    and Julian Huxley…</p>

                <p>Another American biologist who subscribed to eugenics was Linus Pauling (1901 – 1994). In 1959 he
                    wrote the
                    'human germ plasm, which determines the nature of the human race, is deteriorating…Defective genes
                    are not being
                    eliminated from the pool of human germ plasm so rapidly as in the past, because we have made medical
                    progress
                    and have developed feelings of compassion such as to make it possible for us to permit the
                    individuals who carry
                    the bad genes to have more progeny than in the past. [In 1968] Pauling suggested that carriers of
                    the sickle
                    cell anemia gene should be branded on the forehead so that they could identify other carriers and be
                    careful to
                    avoid having children with them…Pauling's major research achievement was his discovery of the
                    biochemical
                    abnormality of the hemoglobin molecule in the gene responsible for sickle cell anemia, for which he
                    was awarded
                    the Nobel Prize in 1954.</p>

                <p>Another eminent American geneticist who supported eugenics was Joshua Lederberg, head of the
                    department of
                    genetics at Stanford University from 1959 – 1978…He went on to discuss possible eugenic solutions to
                    the problem
                    of genetic deterioration and suggested that in the future genetic engineering might be the best way
                    ahead,
                    rather than the traditional eugenic proposals for altering fertility. In 1958 Lederberg was awarded
                    the Nobel
                    Prize for his work on genetic engineering in bacteria by the introduction of new genes."</p>

                    biology,

                    of Harvard; Irving Fisher, president of Yale, who was also president of the Eugenics Research

                <p>"In 1941 the Nazis set up the concentration camps for the killing of the Jews. It has often been
                    asserted that
                    the killing of the Jews was motivated by eugenics and indeed that eugenics inevitably leads in due
                    course to the
                    killing of "undesirables."…Contrary to this frequent assertion, the Nazis did not kill the Jews on
                    eugenic
                    grounds. It is true that Hitler and the Nazis and many of the German academic and scientific
                    eugenicists of the
                    Nazi era were anti-Semitic, but they did not assert that the Jews were intellectually inferior."</p>

                        consider the Jews "intellectually inferior." This statement, true or not, is irrelevant. Hitler

                        the Jews <em>racially</em> inferior. He, like the American eugenic leaders that he followed,
                        wanted to
                        create a superior Nordic race to rule the world. The Jews were a threat to that eugenic vision

                        Last but not least, is anyone foolish enough to believe that the guidelines for sterilization
                        would be
                        applied equally? Does anyone truly believe that mandatory sterilization wouldn't be selectively

                <p>"The eugenicists' objective of securing the sterilization of these groups achieved its first success
                    in the
                    United States in 1907, when the state legislature of Indiana passed a law 'to prevent the
                    procreation of
                    confirmed criminals, idiots, imbeciles, and rapists' by sterilizing them…By 1913 this law had been
                    adopted by 12
                    states; and by 1931, by 30 states, and these laws were implemented on a substantial scale. Orders
                    for
                    sterilization were sometimes challenged in the courts. In 1927 a landmark decision on the
                    sterilization of the
                    mentally retarded in the United States was made in the Supreme Court in <em>Buck v. Bell</em>. The
                    case
                    concerned the legality of sterilizing a young woman named Carrie Buck on the grounds that she was
                    mentally
                    retarded. The decision of the Virginia court to permit the sterilization was upheld by the Supreme
                    Court."</p>

                    <p>Buck was paroled shortly after her sterilization was performed. She eventually married Charlie
                        Dentamore to
                        whom she remained married until her death. Reporters and researchers that visited Buck later in
                        life claimed
                        she was a woman of normal intelligence. Later in life, she expressed regret that she had been
                        unable to have
                        additional children.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

                    <p>Additionally, Carrie had a child prior to being sterilized; her child was not retarded either:

                    <p>This offspring of a "lewd and immoral" women excelled in deportment and performed adequately,
                        although not
                        brilliantly, in her academic subjects.<a href="#fn2" id="ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

                    <p>The Supreme Court justified sterilizing "mentally retarded" individuals based on a woman who was
                        wrongly
                        accused of being retarded. If a case of this magnitude was botched, how much confidence can be

                <p>"It has been estimated…that by 1935 about 20,000 sterilizations had been carried out and that by 1970
                    this figure
                    had risen to about 60,000, of whom about half were mentally retarded and half were psychiatric

                <p>"Eugenicists in the United States secured a third success in the control of immigration in the 1924
                    Immigration
                    Act. From the 1880s onward there had been a large influx of immigrants into the United States from
                    southern and
                    eastern Europe, and eugenicists of the time were concerned that these people were of inferior
                    genetic stock…The
                    major provision of the act was that annual immigration from each European nation should be limited
                    to 2 percent
                    of U.S. residents born in that country. Since the great majority of Americans were from northwest
                    Europe, the
                    effect of this was to greatly reduce immigration from eastern and southern Europe."</p>

                <p>"In the 1960s, support for eugenics began to decline. All over the world eugenics societies put
                    themselves into
                    voluntary liquidation. A critical year was 1969, in which the American Eugenics Society ended
                    publication of its
                    journal <em>Eugenics Quarterly</em> and replaced it with <em>Social Biology,</em> and the British
                    Eugenics
                    Society ended publication of the <em>Eugenics Review</em> and replaced it with the <em>Journal of
                        Biological
                        Science</em>…In 1972 the American Eugenics Society changed its name to The Society for the Study
                    of Social
                    Biology and dissociated itself from eugenics. Two years later the president of the new society,
                    Frederick
                    Osborn, wrote of this change, "The society was groping for a wholly new definition of purpose. It
                    was no longer
                    thinking in terms of 'superior' individuals, 'superior' family stocks, or even of social conditions
                    that would
                    bring about a 'better' distribution of births. It was thinking in terms of diversity, in terms of
                    the genetic
                    attributes appropriate to different kinds of physical and social environments." This amounted to a
                    total
                    repudiation of eugenics. The British Eugenics Society lasted another two decades before it, too,
                    distanced
                    itself from eugenics in 1988 by changing its name to the Galton Institute."</p>

                <p>"With respect to eugenics's intellectual basis, it came to be increasingly asserted that the
                    principal
                    propositions of eugenics were wrong, that eugenics is a 'pseudoscience,' that the eugenicists did
                    not understand
                    genetics, that all genes are equally valuable, that intelligence and personality traits have no
                    genetic basis,
                    and that eugenic policies would not work because they are based on false genetics. I have discussed

                    misconceived criticisms of eugenics in my book <em>Dysgenics</em> and will not consider them again

                    has to be
                    struck between individual rights and social rights. Individual rights consist of the personal
                    liberties of
                    individuals, whereas social rights consist of the rights of society to curtail the liberties of

                    <p>(This is an intentionally deceptive argument. The author's assertion that "social rights consist
                        of the
                        rights of <em>society</em> to curtail" implies that "society" will be involved in the
                        decision-making
                        process. This is not the case. "Society" will not be called upon to determine its "interests" in
                        a eugenical
                        society. This task, as the author well knows, will be reserved for the politically favored
                        classes. For this
                        reason, "individual rights" remain the only legitimate starting point for determining both the
                        rights of
                        individuals <em>and</em> society. (Society, composed of individuals, is automatically protected
                        when each
                        individual is protected.) It should also be noted that "individual rights" has <em>never</em>
                        meant that an
                        individual has the "right" to <em>violate</em> the rights of others. Many who challenge the
                        notion of
                        "individual rights" imply otherwise; as the author does below regarding AIDS.)</p>

                    liberty of infecting others, and were allowed to travel freely and to enter the countries without
                    any checks on

                <p>"A Eugenic Law of 1994 made it compulsory for pregnant women to undergo prenatal diagnosis for the
                    presence of
                    genetic and congenital disorders in the fetus and to have abortions where these disorders have been
                    diagnosed.
                    Chinese physicians and geneticists are much more sympathetic to eugenics than are those in Western
                    democracies…Between 92 percent and 98 percent of Chinese physicians and geneticists in [a] survey
                    supported the
                    termination of pregnancies where the father was diagnosed as having a serious genetic or congenital
                    disorder and

                    whereas only
                    about 5 percent of physicians and geneticists in the Western democracies said they would do this.
                    The reason for
                    this difference between China and the West is that greater priority is given to social rights in

                    similar
                    investigation was carried out by Jamison of 36 British poets born between 1705 and 1805, in which
                    she concluded
                    that they were 30 times more likely to have had manic-depressive illness than their contemporaries
                    and 20 times
                    more likely to have been committed to an asylum…</p>

                <p>A second strand of evidence for an association between mental illness and creative achievement comes
                    from studies
                    of living writers and artists. Several studies of this kind have found a high incidence of
                    depression and
                    manic-depressive psychosis…Ludwig studied 59 creative writers and a matched control group of
                    professional people
                    and found that the writers had about five times greater lifetime prevalence of depression, mania,
                    and anxiety
                    states."</p>

                    mining all their harbors, which was steadily isolating them from the rest of the

                <p>This argument has also been
                    put forward by the German geneticist Volkmar Weiss. He posits a genetical system
                    for intelligence in which there are three genetic types – the first consisting
                    of approximately 5 percent highly intelligent individuals (IQs of 130), the
                    second of about 27 percent average-level individuals (IQs of 112), and the third
                    of about 68 percent dull individuals (IQs of 94). He suggests that societies
                    need this kind of intelligence distribution to maintain social stability.
                    Societies need a small elite to occupy the top positions, a greater number of
                    executives to carry out the instructions of the elite, and a large number of

                    supporters, not the opposition, who are afflicted with a
                    <em>mental</em> <em>disorder</em>. Number
                    (3): Does never-ending war abroad and ever-escalating police militarization at
                    home qualify as “aggressivity?” Number (4): Repeated failure to honor financial

                    “honors” its financial obligations when it can print or seize the money it
                    needs. This hardly counts. Number (6): No regard for the truth? Is there
                    <em>anyone</em> guiltier of this than the

                    occur through casual, unplanned, and unprotected sex, all of which are

                    </span>

                <p>“We have now completed our
                    examination of the objectives of eugenics and concluded that they consist of the
                    reduction or elimination of genetic diseases and disorders, mental retardation
                    and psychopathic personality, and the increase of intelligence and the
                    personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness. It is now time to
                    consider how these objectives could be achieved. There are two broad strategies
                    for the promotion of eugenics. These consist of the classical eugenics of
                    selective reproduction and the new eugenics of human biotechnology. We discuss
                    classical eugenics first and turn to the new eugenics in Part IV.
                </p>
                <p>Classical eugenics attempts
                    to apply to humans the selective breeding techniques used for centuries on
                    animals and plants to produce improved strains by breeding from the best
                    individuals. The way this should be applied to humans was set out by Galton. He
                    proposed that the population should be divided into three categories which he
                    designated the ‘desirables,’ the ‘passables,’ and the ‘undesirables.’ The
                    ‘desirables’ were those endowed with the qualities of health, intelligence, and
                    moral character and, therefore, whose fertility it would be the objective of
                    eugenics to increase. Galton called this ‘positive eugenics.’ The ‘undesirables’
                    were those particularly poorly endowed within contemporary terms, Galton’s
                    ‘undesirables’ are those with genetic disorders, the mentally retarded, the
                    unintelligent, and those with low agreeableness and conscientiousness consisting
                    of criminals and psychopaths. Galton’s ‘desirables’ are the healthy, the
                    intelligent and those with the personality traits of high agreeableness and
                    conscientiousness.”

                    <span>Mendel discovers eugenics observing plants:</span>
                </p>
                <p>“The basic genetic processes
                    were discovered in the 1860s by the Czechoslovak monk Gregor Mendel, but his
                    discoveries were so far ahead of his time that no one understood them until
                    1900. Mendel worked out the principles of inheritance on plants, but the
                    principles apply quite generally to plants, animals, and humans. The first
                    essential point of Mendel’s discoveries was that genes normally come in pairs.
                    Each member of these pairs is called an <em>
                        allele</em>; so normally everyone has two alleles for each genetically determined
                    characteristic. People frequently write of ‘genes’ when, strictly speaking, they
                    mean ‘alleles.’
                </p>
                <p>There are four kinds of
                    alleles: additive, dominant, recessive, and X-linked.
                    <em>Additive alleles</em> both contribute equally and therefore additively to
                    the expression of the characteristics they affect.
                    <em>Dominant alleles</em> are so-called because they dominate, or overpower,
                    the recessive allele with which they are paired, so that the recessive has no
                    effect or, sometimes, just a small effect. Conversely,
                    <em>recessive alleles</em> are dominated, or overpowered, by the dominant
                    genes with which they are paired. <em>X-linked
                        alleles</em> are an exception to the general rule that genes come in pairs. They
                    come singly on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome, and thus only
                    one of any X-linked alleles…
                </p>
                <p>When people mate, they
                    transmit one of their two alleles to their children. The children therefore
                    receive one allele from their father and one from their mother, giving them two
                    alleles…Suppose that for a particular characteristic there are two alleles,
                    labeled A and B, in the population. In one kind of mating, both father and
                    mother have two A alleles. These are designated AA and are both said to be
                    ‘homozygous’ for this gene. Their children will inherit one A from their father
                    and one A from their mother, so they will also be AA. Thus, all the children of
                    this kind of mating are the same as the parents, and all the siblings are the
                    same as each other. A parallel result would happen if both parents were BB, in
                    which case all their children would be BB…
                </p>
                <p>If all genetic inheritance
                    were like this, eugenics would be easy. If the A allele is desirable and the B
                    allele is undesirable, perhaps because it is responsible for a genetic disorder,
                    all that a eugenic program would have to do would be to sterilize the BBs. The
                    BB genes would be eliminated from the population and the undesirable
                    characteristic caused by the B allele would also be eliminated.
                </p>
                <p>However, eugenics programs
                    are not so straightforward as this. In another kind of mating, both parents will
                    have one A and one B allele – they are both AB. These couples will produce four
                    allele combinations in their children. (1) child will inherit an A from the
                    father and an A from its mother and be an AA; (2) the second will inherit a B
                    from its father and a B from its mother and be a BB; (3) the third will inherit
                    an A from its father and a B from its mother and be an AB; (4) the fourth will
                    inherit a B from its father and an A from its mother and be a BA. But a BA is
                    exactly the same as an AB, so there are only three different genotypes in the
                    population; the AAs, the BBs, and the ABs.

                <p>“The German geneticist Otmar
                    von Verschuer examined the family pedigree of the composer Robert Schumann. He
                    found that the Schumann family had been quite ordinary artisans for many
                    generations and that neither Robert’s father nor mother, nor any of his 136
                    ancestors or relatives, had displayed any musical talent. This illustrates the
                    principle that highly gifted individuals not infrequently appear as a result of
                    the inheritance of an unusually favorable combination of genes carried by
                    average parents.”

                    world, might have justified sterilization long before the “unusually favorable
                    combination of genes” had an opportunity to manifest?)

                <p>“In the real world neither
                    the genetic elite nor the genetic underclass breeds entirely true. The genetic
                    elite produces some children whose intelligence is lower than that of the
                    parents, while the genetic underclass produces some children whose intelligence
                    is higher than that of the parents.”
                </p>
                <p>(I
                    need to point this out again: The so-called “genetic underclass” with their
                    “lower intelligence” has produced billions of hard working /
                    <em>honest</em> people. As the author admits,
                    lower intelligence does not necessarily result in the creation of
                    lower-intelligence children…What he fails to admit is that it doesn’t
                    necessarily result in children who contribute less to society either. I’d be
                    willing to bet there are far more sociopaths among the more intelligent genetic
                    elite, especially those who obtain positions of power within the ruling class.

                <p>We
                    mustn’t forget that it is the <em>elite</em>
                    who murdered hundreds of millions of human beings over the past 100 years. They,
                    in line with the author’s eugenicist view, probably consider their democide
                    little more than a “good start.”
                </p>
                <p>Continuing: After explaining a theory that states M1
                    M1 allele pairs produce the
                    highest intelligence, and M2 M2 allele pairs produce the lowest, the author
                    proposes a negative eugenic solution.)
                </p>
                <p>“A program of negative
                    eugenics would reduce the number of children produced by the M2M2s….In terms of
                    the mating model shown in Table 10.1, the program could be implemented by the
                    sterilization of the M2M2s. This would prevent the reproduction of the mating
                    combinations in the bottom three rows of the table and would prevent the birth
                    of a lot of M2M2 children. The effect of this would be that a much higher
                    proportion of children would be M1M1 or M1M2 children and that the intelligence
                    level of the child generation would rise. Some M2M2 children would continue to
                    be born from M1M2 – M1M2 matings (from parents of average intelligence) because
                    a quarter of the children of these [would be born] M2M2…Nevertheless,
                    sterilization of all M2M2s would have a large eugenic impact in reducing the
                    numbers of low-intelligence children. Although some of these would continue to
                    be born with M1M2-M1M2 matings, a continuation of such a policy over several
                    generations would progressively weed out the M2 allele, and the intelligence
                    level of the population would increase in each generation.”

                    twentieth century, a number of psychologists have shown that it is possible to
                    breed animals for intelligence and temperament. The classical study of breeding
                    for increased intelligence in rats was carried out by Tryon (1940). He measured
                    rats’ intelligence by their ability to learn how to run through a maze without
                    making errors of turning into cul-de-sacs. He began by selecting a group of
                    ‘brights,’ who did well at this task, and a group of ‘dulls,’ who did poorly. He
                    bred from these two groups over 21 generations and obtained two genetically
                    different strains. A similar study was carried out by W.R. Thompson (1954). He
                    found that over six generations the strains of bright and dull rats
                    progressively diverged. The bright rats became progressively brighter and
                    reduced their average errors in the maze from 190 to 142, while the dull rats
                    became progressively duller…

                    breed them in the hope of obtaining an exceptionally fast horse that will win
                    races and earn lots of money. They use the traditional method of selective
                    breeding and typically breed from the fastest 10 percent of stallions and the
                    fastest 50 percent of mares. These selective breeding programs have produced an
                    improved population of thoroughbreds whose average running speeds increased by
                    about 1 percent a year from 1952 to 1977. What has happened is that the genes
                    (alleles) contributing to fast running speeds have been increased in the
                    thoroughbred population and that at the same time the alternative forms of these
                    genes (alleles) for poorer running speeds have been reduced. This has led to an
                    improvement in the average running speed of the entire population.

                        <em>brighter</em>. Second, it raises the
                        following question: What if this breeding approach, while increasing “average”
                        ability, inevitably leads to stagnation in the gene pool? What if it increases
                        “average ability,” but no longer produces genetic combinations that lead to

                    the case of intelligence, there would not be any increase in the highest
                    intelligence hitherto achieved…This is because all the right genes and the most
                    favorable environmental conditions have already appeared from time to time and
                    produced people like Pascal and Galton. What a eugenic program would accomplish
                    would be the reduction or elimination of the genes for low intelligence. The
                    average intelligence level of the population would be improved, just as the
                    average running speed of thoroughbreds has been improved; but there would be no
                    increase of the highest IQs, just as there has been no improvement in the

                <p>“It has often been asserted
                    that eugenic policies would not work because of regression to the mean. The
                    phenomenon of <em>regression to the mean</em>
                    is the tendency of parents at the extremes of continuously distributed traits,
                    such as intelligence, to have children who are less extreme than themselves. In
                    other words, the children regress toward the mean. Thus highly intelligent
                    parents have children who are, on average, less intelligent than themselves; and

                <p>These assertions that
                    regression to the mean would render a eugenic program ineffective…are obviously
                    wrong because if they were true the selective breeding of plants and animals, of
                    which a number of examples have been given in the first two sections of this
                    chapter, would not work. If these assertions were correct, improvements brought
                    about by selective breeding would disappear after several generations through
                    regression to the mean. Furthermore, natural selection would not work either
                    because evolution by the survival of the fittest could not take place through
                    the regression of the descendants of the fittest back to the population mean.”
                </p>
                <p>(“Survival of the fittest” is hardly a good example.
                    It continues to evolve
                    “forward” precisely because of the synergistic effect of
                    <em>many</em> different genes and characteristics combining to yield
                    evolutionary advantages. It isn’t a rigid process that favors one specific set
                    of “genes” over another.
                </p>
                <p>Regarding “improvements brought about by selective
                    breeding,” the “improvements”
                    are seen in higher averages, but what about
                    <em>real</em> improvements; as in breaking
                    previous levels of achievement? Contrary to the author’s assertion, these
                    <em>do</em> seem to “disappear.” And when
                    everyone has an IQ of 120, doesn’t 120 now become the new
                    <em>average</em> IQ? (The equivalent of 100?)
                    Although this might not count, strictly speaking, as “regression to the mean,”
                    it could be seen as a regression nonetheless because it eliminates the natural
                    rise in ability that might have otherwise occurred.)

                <p>“The initial discovery on
                    which the pill was based was made in 1937 when Makepeace found that progesterone
                    suppresses ovulation in rabbits. In 1951 Gregory Pincus of the Worcester
                    Institute met the wealthy philanthropist Mrs. Stanley McCormick, and together
                    they worked out the program of research and development for the contraceptive
                    pill. Mrs. McCormick donated about $2 million, and additional grants were
                    obtained from the G.D. Searle Company and the Syntax Corporation. It took nine
                    years to bring the pill to market, which took place in 1960, at a total cost of
                    approximately $6 million, equivalent to around $60 million in real terms in the
                    year 2000.
                </p>
                <p>Costs of this magnitude are
                    considerable even for the large U.S. foundations and corporations. Hence in
                    recent years, around 70 percent of the funding for research on contraception in
                    the United States has come from the government. In the world as a whole, about
                    75 percent of research on contraception is carried out in the United States. It
                    is therefore largely in the United States that the difficulties in the way of
                    research on contraception need to be reduced. The principal changes required are
                    the simplification of the FDA testing requirements, and increase in the
                    patent-protection period, and a reduction in the potential financial losses
                    pharmaceutical companies are likely to incur through litigation. The losses from
                    litigation could be reduced by placing a limit on the amount of damages so that
                    compensation was given for economic loss and for pain and suffering; but
                    punitive damages could not be awarded except in the rare cases where the
                    manufacturer could be shown to have acted recklessly. Alternatively, actions for
                    damages against drugs for which FDA approval has been given could be

                <p>“There is substantial
                    evidence that women who have unplanned pregnancies and request abortions are
                    predominantly less the intelligent (sic) and the more psychopathic…A British
                    study…examined the relationship between the numbers of pregnancy terminations
                    per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 in 90 English regions in relation to a deprivation
                    index obtained from the percentage of the population on welfare. The correlation
                    between the two measures was .61, indicating that the greater the deprivation in
                    a region, the higher the abortion rate. Since deprivation is associated with low
                    intelligence and high psychopathic personality, the impact of abortion is to
                    reduce the birth rate of the less intelligent and more psychopathic. For this
                    reason, abortion needs to be made free and easily available.
                </p>
                <p>The eugenic impact of
                    abortion in the United States has been demonstrated by Steven Levitt, an
                    economist at the University of Chicago, and John Donohue, a lawyer at Stanford
                    University. They noted that following the Supreme Court decision in 1973
                    effectively legalizing abortion throughout the United States, the annual numbers
                    of abortions increased from approximately 750,000 in 1962 to approximately 1.6
                    million in 1980. They also noted that most of this large increase in the numbers
                    of abortions occurred among the poor, blacks, and the underclass, who produce
                    the greatest numbers of criminals. Hence, they conclude that approximately 1
                    million potential criminals who would previously have been born were aborted.
                    They estimate that this explains about half of the reduction in crime that
                    occurred between 1991 and 1997. In further support of this thesis, they found
                    that states with the highest abortion rates after 1973 experienced the greatest
                    reduction in crime some 20 years later…This study demonstrates the considerable
                    eugenic benefits accruing from the legalization of abortion.”

                    notification laws is illustrated by the experience in Minnesota, where a

                <p>“A possible approach to the
                    problem of reducing dysgenic fertility is to offer those with low intelligence
                    and psychopathic personality financial incentives not to have children. A
                    proposal of this kind was advanced in the early 1970’s by William Shockley and
                    received quite a lot of publicity because of Shockley’s fame as a Nobel laureate
                    for the discovery of the transistor.
                </p>
                <p>Shockley’s proposal was to
                    offer payments for sterilization to all nontaxpayers with IQs below 100. Most
                    people with IQs below 100, who comprise half the population, pay taxes; so
                    perhaps about 10 percent to 20 percent of the total population would be eligible
                    for the payments…Although the scheme was designed primarily to attract those
                    with low IQs, the stipulation that those eligible for the payments would have to
                    be nontaxpayers would also attract a certain number of those with psychopathic
                    personality, one characteristic of which is antipathy to…paying taxes.”

                <p>(Sure…because “antipathy” toward funding psychopaths
                    in government is surely
                    “psychopathic.”)
                </p>
                <p>“The payments proposed were
                    $1,000 for each IQ point below 100. Thus, for example, someone with an IQ of 70
                    would be paid $30,000…Payments of $30,000 to those with IQs of 70 in 1972 would
                    need to be adjusted about 10-fold for inflation and would amount to about
                    $300,000 for the early twenty-first century…”

                    scoring as low as possible on the IQ test so that they could receive an even
                    larger payment. He suggests dropping the IQ-rated payment scale and just
                    offering a flat-rate payment to all nontaxpayers, stating that many would accept
                    something much lower; “perhaps as low as a few hundred dollars.”)

                    the 1960s and 1970s made having babies a rational option for women with low
                    intelligence, no educational qualifications, and poor employment prospects…To
                    many [of these women], a preferable option is to have babies. These enable them

                    greater freedom and leisure…welfare provides a satisfactory lifestyle compared
                    with the alternatives. The effect of this is that they do not mind becoming

                    was that the welfare mothers should identify the fathers of their children and
                    that these would be offered the options of paying child support, of carrying out
                    community service work, of being sterilized and receiving a payment of $1,000,

                    for welfare mothers and would require sterilization as a condition of receiving
                    welfare. This scheme would not prevent these men from having children in the
                    future, which could be accomplished by the removal of sperm from the testes and

                <p>“A further study on this
                    issue in Denmark concerned 738 sexual offenders castrated between 1929 and 1959.
                    This study found that their reoffending rate was 1.8 percent, as compared with a
                    reoffending rate of 9.7 percent among noncastrated offenders. This result has
                    been confirmed in Germany, where a 1970 law allowed judges to offer convicted
                    offenders the option of a reduced term of imprisonment conditional on
                    castration. About 400 castrations were carried out from 1970 to 1986. Wille and
                    Beier followed up 99 of them for 11 years after their release from prison and
                    found that 3 percent of them reoffended, as compared with 46 percent among a
                    matched group of sex offenders who had not been castrated.”
                </p>
                <p>(Alright, just a few points here: First, there is a
                    huge difference between the
                    first statistic from Denmark where more than 90 percent did not reoffend despite
                    <em>not</em> being castrated VS the study in
                    Germany where only 54 percent did not reoffend. This really calls into question
                    the criteria for labeling a person a “sex offender.” Mandatory castration could
                    easily be abused through the creation of ridiculous laws, selectively enforced,
                    to achieve eugenic ends. For instance, an 18-year old who has consensual sex
                    with his 16-year old girlfriend could be categorized a “sex offender” just the
                    same as a man who puts a gun to a woman’s head and rapes her. Last but not
                    least, there is the problem of how easily false allegations can be made or how
                    different charges can be chosen by prosecutors to force a plea deal and win a
                    conviction. The idea of <em>innocent</em>
                    individuals being subjected to a punishment that will alter them forever should
                    make every thinking individual pause.)

                <p>“The second way to prevent
                    unlicensed couples from having babies would be to sterilize all children at
                    around the age of 12. This is probably the only method for making the plan
                    effective. When the children grow up and wish to have children, they would be
                    required to obtain the license and could then have the sterilization reversed.
                    There are several ways in which the sterilization and its later reversal could
                    be carried out. At the age of 12, girls could be required to have some form of
                    long lasting contraception, such as an IUD (intrauterine device) or Norplant. At
                    appropriate intervals they would be required to have their IUD checked or their
                    Norplant capsules replaced…

                <p>Boys would have to be
                    sterilized by vasectomy. When they became adults and found partners with whom
                    they wanted to have children, they would have to apply for parental licenses. If
                    these were granted, the vasectomies would be reversed…The mandatory
                    sterilization of boys is more contentious than the requirement of long-lasting
                    contraception for girls, but it could well come to be recognized as the best
                    solution to the otherwise intractable problem of irresponsible men who do not
                    care if they get girls pregnant or who take pride in fathering numerous children
                    whom they frequently abandon.”

                <p>(By

                    children they father.)

                <p>“In time, the mandatory
                    sterilization of boys might come to seem no more objectionable than inoculations
                    against infectious diseases, which are taken for granted as desirable.
                    Alternatively, technological developments may provide a means for sterilizing
                    boys for a temporary period, which would be more acceptable to public opinion
                    than vasectomy. A possible development of this kind would be the production of a
                    virus causing temporary sterilization.

                    time. The ideal for humans would be a contraceptive virus acting for about 10
                    years that could be given to 12-year-old boys. When they were aged 22, they
                    could apply for licenses for parenthood. If they failed to obtain these, they

                <p>“A number of subsequent
                    eugenicists advanced a variety of proposals by which the state would provide

                    proposed…that the state should give allowances for children proportional to
                    their fathers’ incomes, such that fathers with high incomes would receive higher
                    allowances per child than fathers with low incomes. This would provide
                    incentives for high-earning fathers, assumed to have high intelligence and
                    desirable personality traits, to have more children, while avoiding the
                    provision of similar incentives to low-earning fathers…

                <p>Another strategy for
                    positive eugenics would be to increase the taxation of the childless. These
                    taxes should be progressive, as they normally are, so that those with the
                    highest incomes would be the most heavily taxed…Although this plan has not been
                    advanced in the contemporary world, it would seem to have some promise as a
                    means of inducing high earners to increase their fertility. Such a proposal
                    would be relatively easy to introduce politically because childless high earners
                    are few in number and would not be expected to receive much public sympathy if
                    they were taxed more heavily. A program of this kind has much to recommend it,
                    particularly if it were introduced in conjunction with tax allowances for
                    children, thereby providing higher earners with both a carrot and a stick to
                    increase their fertility.”

                <p>“One of the most ethically
                    contentious forms of eugenics is mandatory sterilization, as was extensively
                    carried out on the <em>mentally retarded </em>
                    and<em> criminals</em> in the United States,
                    Japan, and a number of European countries in the early and middle decades of the
                    twentieth century. [Emphasis added] From the 1970s onwards, sterilization was
                    widely condemned as ethically unacceptable. For instance, one U.S. biologist,
                    Lee Silver, wrote that ‘forced sterilizations in America were wrong because they
                    restricted the reproductive liberties of innocent people.’ Jacques Testart, a
                    French geneticist, wrote that ‘negative eugenics, imposed in opposition to human
                    liberty and dignity, has become unacceptable in the majority of democratic
                    societies.’ And Matt Ridley, and English sociobiologist, wrote that eugenic
                    sterilization ‘was oppressive and cruel because it required the full power of
                    the state to be asserted over the rights of the individual.’

                <p>These objections to the
                    ethical legitimacy of sterilization fail to recognize that there are social
                    rights as well as individual rights. While there are individual rights of
                    freedom of expression and behavior, there are also social rights to restrict
                    these freedoms where the exercise of them is socially damaging.”<span>&nbsp;

                <p>(This is an example of putting the cart before the
                    horse. So called “social
                    rights” stem from individual rights. Society can’t kill an innocent person and
                    “part out” their body simply because it has determined it would be socially
                    beneficial to do so. Besides, this concept of “social rights” is itself a lie; a
                    creation of INDIVIDUAL elites who seek to dominate, not empower, the society
                    they claim to serve.)
                </p>
                <p>“Thus, in terms of general
                    principle, it is unquestionably ethically legitimate for societies to curtail
                    individual rights when the exercise of these is judged likely to inflict social
                    damage. This is the principle underlying the restriction of individual liberties
                    in the Western democracies and, no doubt, in authoritarian states as well. The
                    liberties that are curtailed can be ordered along a continuum ranging from
                    behaviors that indisputably cause social damage to those for which there is a
                    probability or possibility that they may cause social damage…For instance, no
                    one disputes that the rights to liberty of those convicted of serious crimes
                    should be curtailed by imprisonment in the interests of preserving the rights of
                    other citizens to be protected from crime.”
                </p>
                <p>(Those who have committed a serious crime have
                    <em>already</em> violated the rights of another
                    person. There is a huge difference between limiting a person’s freedom because
                    they have provably abused that freedom VS limiting a person’s freedom when they
                    have done nothing to violate the rights of another.)
                </p>
                <p>“It has sometimes been
                    argued that sterilization is not justified because normally there is not a
                    certainty but only a possibility that social problem groups will transmit their
                    characteristics to their children. For example, Adrian Raine, a psychologist at
                    the University of California who specializes in the psychology of crime, wrote
                    that ‘current research indicates a genetic <em>
                        predisposition</em> to crime only; individuals are not born to commit crime;
                    there can be no genetic destiny for crime as such. Eugenic solutions are not
                    supported by the findings of genetic research.’ This argument against eugenic
                    sterilization to curtail the reproduction of criminals cannot be accepted.
                </p>
                <p>Society prohibits many
                    behaviors on the basis that there is some actuarial possibility that they may
                    inflict social harm, but no certainty that they will do so. For instance,
                    societies impose speed limits for driving on public roads and highways. There is
                    no certainty that driving faster than the speed limit will cause any harm and a
                    probability that in most cases it will not. Nevertheless, there is an enhanced
                    possibility that it will do so, and on these grounds society legitimately
                    prohibits it…The same actuarial argument applies to the children produced by
                    criminals and the mentally retarded and provides the ethical legitimacy for
                    their sterilization.”

                    <em>after</em> they have been caught speeding.
                    The government doesn’t look at all drivers and decide, prior to any violation,

                    the state institution where Carrie Buck was confined recommended that she should
                    be sterilized. This recommendation was challenged in the Virginia high court by
                    a group of conservative Christians who held it was a violation of individual
                    rights. The Virginia court upheld the decision to sterilize. In 1927, the case
                    went to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided by a vote of eight to
                    one in favor of sterilization. The Supreme Court’s decision was read by Justice
                    Oliver Wendell Holmes: <span>&nbsp;</span>
                </p>
                <p>‘We have seen more than once
                    that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It
                    would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of
                    the state for these lesser sacrifices…in order to prevent our being swamped with
                    incompetence. It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute
                    degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility,
                    society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit for continuing their kind.
                    The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover
                    cutting the Fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.’
                </p>
                <p>Following this judgment,
                    Carrie Buck was sterilized. It is evident that in his justification for the
                    Supreme Court’s decision, Oliver Wendell Holmes was relying on the principle
                    that there are social rights that may sometimes override the individual’s rights
                    to have children. He noted that the state requires its citizens to give their
                    lives, in time of war, for the benefit of their country and that it requires
                    infants to be vaccinated in the social interest of preventing the spread of
                    contagious diseases. He pointed out that the mentally retarded impose costs on
                    society and that any children they have are likely to be mentally retarded; and
                    that to avert the likely social costs of these future children, the mentally
                    retarded can legitimately be sterilized.”
                </p>
                <p>(As
                    mentioned earlier, neither Carrie Buck <em>nor</em>
                    her child was “mentally retarded.” So, not even the
                    <em>landmark case</em>, put forward to justify the state’s right to perform
                    compulsory sterilization, met the so-called
                    <em>legitimate</em> requirements for
                    sterilization. How many others, falsely designated and sterilized, had their
                    rights violated as well?
                </p>
                <p>As
                    a side note, the author disputes the fact that Carrie Buck was not retarded and,
                    of her child, he says “The school records show that she obtained predominantly C
                    grades and was required to repeat a term in one class…Her intelligence was not
                    tested, but the fact that she was required to repeat a term indicates that she
                    was backward. Just how backward she was cannot be determined with any degree of
                    confidence.” For more information, there is a short article on Carrie Buck
                    available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Buck )<span>&nbsp;

                <p>“Multicultural societies are
                    less well governed and have poorer economic performance than ethnically and
                    racially homogenous societies because the competing ethnic and racial groups
                    expend too much of their energy and resources in trying to advance the interests
                    of their own group.”

                <p>(It
                    seems that this principle applies to politics as well…keep the people divided

                    are exploiting them.)

                        The author again asserts that Hitler was not practicing eugenics against the
                        Jews:</span></p>
                <p>“These arguments [that
                    Hitler exterminated Jews for eugenical reasons] cannot be accepted. First,
                    eugenics does not require the extermination of undesirables. It is sufficient
                    for eugenics that the mentally retarded and recidivist criminals should be
                    sterilized. Second, eugenic considerations did not play any significant role in
                    the Nazi program for the extermination of the Jews. Hitler did not regard the
                    Jews as genetically inferior.”
                </p>
                <p>(Again, this is a completely disingenuous argument.
                    Hitler did not have to see
                    the Jews as “inferior” in order to see them as “undesirable.” The concept of
                    eugenics – that it aims to increase “desirables” and decrease “undesirables” –
                    leaves the definition of both terms open to interpretation. Worse, their
                    definitions are <em>driven</em> by the
                    overarching goal of eugenics which, according to the author himself, is to
                    increase the power of the nation state to a point that one group of elite will
                    dominate the world. No such global elite could allow
                    <em>any</em> group (whether the group was
                    intelligent, talented, or otherwise), to challenge their power. Any group that
                    <em>did</em> challenge their power would be
                    immediately categorized as <em>undesirable</em>…This is common sense.)

                        Even if Hitler was practicing Eugenics, he just did it wrong:</span></p>
                <p>“If eugenic views had
                    contributed to the Nazis’ extermination of the Jews, gypsies, and others, this
                    would certainly have been an ethically unacceptable misapplication of eugenics.
                    Nevertheless, the fact that a social philosophy has been unethically applied
                    does not imply that such a misapplication is inevitable or that the social
                    philosophy must be rejected on this account. Numerous social philosophies that
                    are in general commendable have, on occasion, been misapplied. For instance,
                    Christianity consists of a generally acceptable social philosophy, and the
                    application of Christian principles has led to many desirable outcomes, such
                    as…the establishment of welfare provision for the destitute…”
                </p>
                <p>(It’s quite ironic that the author chooses the example
                    of providing “welfare
                    provisions” to destitute individuals as something that makes Christianity
                    <em>good</em>. It would seem this practice of
                    providing welfare for the destitute would clearly constitute a
                    <em>dysgenic</em> policy.)
                </p>
                <p>“Nevertheless, Christianity
                    has sometimes been misapplied. The Christian church has burned at the stake
                    numerous people who disagreed with some of its tenets; and it has waged wars
                    against unbelievers in which abhorrent brutalities have been committed, such as
                    the Crusades in which the Christian crusaders slaughtered large numbers of women
                    and children. These killings must be condemned. However, these deplorable
                    episodes do not justify the total rejection of Christianity or the conclusion
                    that an acceptance of Christianity is the beginning of a slippery slope that
                    inevitably leads to the extermination of those who do not accept its doctrines.
                </p>
                <p>Similarly, the social
                    philosophy of socialism evolved in the Soviet Union into a tyranny…Nevertheless,
                    it would be wrong to conclude that socialism inevitably leads to such an outcome
                    and that socialist ideals of equality, fraternity, and the like must be
                    condemned because these principles were applied in ethically unacceptable ways…”
                </p>
                <p>(It’s pretty simple, really. Let’s assume we have two
                    groups:
                </p>
                <p>Group #1 believes that it has the right to force all
                    others to live a certain
                    way (or even forfeit their progeny) because they have deemed it “desirable.”
                    They aggress against non-aggressors without any concern for the rights of their
                    victims.
                </p>
                <p>Group #2 believes that it has a right to live in a way
                    that it deems desirable,
                    provided that its choices do not violate the rights of others. Unlike the first
                    group, Group #2 only uses force against those who have actually aggressed
                    against them.
                </p>
                <p>In
                    this scenario, the first group is clearly wrong. It makes no difference if the
                    group hides behind “god” or “the state” or “bettering society” to justify its
                    acts of aggression. There is no “slippery slope” to discuss here because the
                    doctrine itself (of using force against innocent human beings) is
                    <em>founded</em> on an “ethically unacceptable”
                    principle. It isn’t that this type of system could
                    <em>become</em> a tyranny; it already <em>
                        is</em> a tyranny. And the longer it is permitted to exist, the more tyrannical
                    it will inevitably become.
                </p>
                <p>Appealing to “moral objectives” without considering
                    the morality of the methods
                    used to obtain them is ridiculous.)
                </p>
                <p>“A number of the opponents
                    of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that
                    although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they
                    could lead to further measures that would be unethical. This argument is
                    unpersuasive because all sorts of measures that are acceptable might, if taken
                    to extremes, lead to other measures that are unacceptable. For example, once
                    society permits the practice of religion, it may be argued, it sets foot on the
                    beginning of a slippery slope that will eventually permit unethical religions
                    that practice human sacrifice…”
                </p>
                <p>(If
                    only the author understood and accepted the concept of
                    <em>individual</em> rights, he’d realize how ridiculous his argument is. No
                    society founded on the concept of individual rights would “permit unethical
                    religions that practice human sacrifice” because, clearly, murdering people is a
                    violation of an individual’s rights! However, a society that resembled the
                    author’s utopia – where powerful groups can violate the rights of the individual
                    whenever they see fit – is a different story altogether.)

                <p>“The major ethical
                    justification for prenatal diagnosis and the termination of pregnancies in cases
                    where a genetic disorder in the fetus has been diagnosed lies in the general
                    principle that in a free society individuals are permitted to make their own
                    decisions concerning the conduct of their lives, unless there is a reasonable
                    case that their behavior is likely to cause social harm. The abortion of a
                    genetically disordered fetus cannot be regarded as likely to cause social harm
                    and hence is ethically justified…
                </p>
                <p>[Another ethical issue]
                    raised by prenatal diagnosis is whether it is ethical for women to refuse to
                    have the procedure carried out. Where the genetic disorder is serious, there is
                    a strong case that such women are acting unethically because they are bringing
                    into the world a child whose health will be seriously impaired, causing distress
                    to itself and to its family, and whose maintenance imposes significant costs on
                    society. This argument can be applied to children with Down’s syndrome, most of
                    whom will never be able to look after themselves or make any positive
                    contribution to society and who will incur medical and welfare resources that
                    could be better directed elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>To incur the risk of giving
                    birth to such a child by refusing to have a prenatal diagnosis can reasonably be
                    argued as unethical. This is the view taken by the American Society of Human
                    Genetics, which posed the question of ‘whether or not a defective fetus should
                    be allowed to be born,’ and suggested that the ethical answer is that it should
                    not. This view has been endorsed by Robert Edwards, a British physician who
                    carries out prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy terminations and who said in 1999
                    that ‘soon it will be a sin of parents to have a child that carries the heavy
                    burden of genetic disease.’ He urged that all pregnant women should be tested
                    for Down’s syndrome and common genetic disorders and that it would be unethical
                    for women to refuse to have these tests carried out and to refuse to have
                    fetuses with serious disorders terminated…
                </p>
                <p>There is a strong case that
                    women have an ethical obligation to have these procedures carried out and that
                    women who refuse to allow this and subsequently bring into the world children
                    with serious genetic disorders are behaving unethically.”

                <p>“A further portent of the
                    reappearance of eugenic thinking occurred in 1998 when James Watson, the
                    co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, spoke at the Congress of Molecular
                    Medicine and advocated the greater use of prenatal diagnosis and termination of
                    fetuses with genetic disorders. He asserted, ‘The truly relevant question for
                    most families is whether an obvious good to them will come from having a child
                    with a major handicap. From this perspective, seeing the bright side of being
                    handicapped is like praising the virtues of extreme poverty.’ Although somewhat
                    opaquely expressed, this can only be construed as an endorsement of eugenics.
                    Once eugenics comes to be accepted again by the scientific community, it will
                    come to be accepted by informed public opinion and the media.”

                    in the first half of the century. The first of these was that the balance
                    between individual and social rights, which all societies have to strike, had
                    swung strongly in favor of strengthening individual rights at the expense of
                    social rights. Individual rights consist of the freedom of individual citizens
                    to behave as they choose, while social rights consist of the right of societies,

                <p>“Individual rights” consist of the freedom of
                    individual citizens to behave as
                    they choose, provided that those individual citizens<em>
                        DO NOT BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT VIOLATES THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS</em>. Nowhere in the
                    concept of “individual rights” is it implied that individuals can “behave as
                    they choose” without regard for the rights of others…The entire point of
                    protecting individual rights is that it leads to the social
                    <em>balance</em> that the author claims to
                    seek. The statement “your rights end where my rights begin” is instructive.
                </p>
                <p>Simply stated, when individual rights are protected,
                    so-called “social rights”
                    will be protected as well. The same cannot be said when the process is reversed.
                    When a government claims the authority to violate the rights of innocent
                    individuals, it simultaneously seizes the power to violate the rights of the
                    society it claims to serve.)

                    impossible at the turn of the millennium for governments in the Western

                    probable that they will continue to support educational and facilitative
                    eugenics consisting of the provision of sex education in schools, information

                    more efficiently as knowledge of them grows, as the morning-after pill becomes
                    more widely known and more easily available, and as more effective forms of
                    contraception are developed. Probably also the welfare support for underclass
                    women to have babies by providing them with welfare incomes and housing will be

                <p>“This idea was advanced in
                    Britain in the 1930s by Brewer, who coined the term
                    <em>eutelegenesis</em> (breeding from afar) for this eugenic use of AID. The
                    scheme was also advocated at about the same time by the American eugenicist
                    Hermann Muller. Muller proposed that the semen of ‘excellent men’ would be
                    stored and women who wanted children would be encouraged to use it, rather than
                    that of their husbands. The ‘excellent men’ selected for this purpose would
                    possess high intelligence and have socially valuable personality qualities, such
                    as a strong moral sense, self-discipline, a strong sense of civic obligation,
                    and energy. ‘How many women,’ Muller asked rhetorically in his book
                    <em>Out of the Night</em>, ‘would be eager and
                    proud to bear and rear a child of Lenin or Darwin?’ The answer to the rhetorical
                    question has turned out to be ‘virtually none.’ The proposal that men could be
                    persuaded to have their wives or female partners inseminated by elite sperm
                    taken from a semen bank rather than by themselves ignores a fundamental theorem
                    of evolutionary psychology, that people are motivated to transmit their own
                    genes. This stumbling block cannot be expected to change. We must therefore
                    conclude that AID from elite donors is unlikely to have any significant eugenic
                    impact in democratic societies.”
                </p>
                <p>(Note that the author says AID wouldn’t have a
                    “significant eugenic impact in
                    <em>democratic</em> societies.” I suppose in a
                    society that was more to the author’s liking, women wouldn’t have much choice in
                    the matter. If they wanted to have children, they would have to accept the sperm
                    offered…for the “good of society,” of course.)

                    <span>Embryo selection:</span>
                </p>
                <p>“In the twenty-first century
                    it will become possible to test embryos for the presence of genes affecting
                    numerous other characteristics, including late-onset diseases and disorders;
                    intelligence; special cognitive abilities, such as mathematical, linguistic, and
                    musical aptitudes; personality traits; athletic abilities; height; body build;
                    and physical appearance. It will then be possible for couples to examine the
                    genetic printouts of a number of embryos and select for implantation the ones
                    they regard as having the most desirable genetic characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>Before this becomes
                    possible, three problems will have to be solved. The first is that most of the
                    genes for which couples can be expected to select have yet to be identified. But
                    progress in the identification of these genes is proceeding rapidly, and the
                    functions of their most common alleles should be discovered by the first two or
                    three decades of the twenty-first century.
                </p>
                <p>The second problem is that
                    in the recent past it has been feasible to grow only a relatively small number
                    of embryos in vitro…Couples presented with the genetic printout of 12 of their
                    embryos would have only a limited choice and might have to make some difficult
                    decisions. For instance, the embryo with the best set of genes for intelligence
                    might also have the genes for the probable development of cancer or heart
                    disease in middle age or the genes for undesirable personality, predisposing the
                    embryo to grow into an intelligent criminal.”
                </p>
                <p>(How long before a eugenics-based society <em>
                        mandates</em> that all embryos must be “selected” in this way? Or, if not that
                    far, how long before mandatory prenatal screening ensures that all “undesirable
                    fetuses” (as determined by the ruling class) must be aborted?<span>&nbsp;
                    </span>Could anything be more dangerous than granting some “experts” the
                    authority to terminate an embryo / fetus based on their assertion that it is
                    “predisposed” to crime?
                </p>
                <p>In
                    this case, there is the obvious problem of who defines “criminal.” (Independent
                    thinkers could be viewed as “predisposed” to crime in a society where
                    independent thought is frowned upon.)
                </p>
                <p>Next, there is the issue of laymen having no idea
                    whatsoever whether or not
                    there is any science at all behind the claims of the experts; or if the
                    so-called “criminal” genes are even present. (If the population accepts a
                    diagnosis of “criminal genes” as sufficient cause for termination, then every
                    fetus the elite deem “undesirable” will, of course, be said to possess criminal
                    genes.)
                </p>
                <p>Last but not least, there is the issue of suggesting
                    that something as complex
                    as human behavior can be reduced to an equation that relies on nothing more than
                    genes! The idea that nature would rigidly “fix” behavioral traits that are
                    adaptable, and necessarily so for survival, is ridiculous.)
                </p>
                <p>“When this procedure becomes
                    widespread, it will become evident that embryo-selected children are virtually
                    always superior to naturally conceived children with respect to their health,
                    intelligence, and personality. This knowledge will spread by word of mouth and
                    through the media.
                </p>
                <p>Couples who can conceive by
                    normal intercourse will choose to have children by embryo selection as a means
                    of ensuring genetically better children than those conceived normally. At first,
                    embryo selection will be used by only a few intelligent, well-informed,
                    farsighted, and affluent couples; but over the course of time increasing numbers
                    of couples will use it, as its advantages become increasingly apparent and
                    understood.”

                        “new genetic underclass” will emerge:</span></p>
                <p>“The eventual adoption of
                    embryo selection by substantial proportions of the population should be regarded
                    as inevitable in the Western democracies. This will be the major avenue for the
                    advancement of eugenics in the twenty-first century…Embryo selection will
                    eventually be adopted by 80 percent to 90 percent of the population and will
                    stabilize at this level.”
                </p>
                <p>(Well, here is another angle to consider: what if
                    authoritarian elites decide
                    that only <em>they</em> should enjoy the
                    advantages of this technology? It isn’t very difficult to imagine. Why would
                    they allow the creation of human beings that could compete with them when,
                    instead, they could gradually create an insurmountable “genetic advantage” over
                    their subjects?)
                </p>
                <p>“The remaining 10 percent to
                    20 percent of babies will continue to be conceived by sexual intercourse. These
                    will be born largely to couples with low intelligence and psychopathic
                    personality who conceive by accident and do not have their unplanned pregnancies
                    terminated.
                </p>
                <p>When this point is reached,
                    the two populations will begin to diverge genetically. A gulf will open up
                    between the embryo-selected children and the ‘unplanned,’ as those conceived by
                    sexual intercourse may come to be known. If, as seems probable, the parents of
                    the unplanned come from the bottom 10 percent to 20 percent of the population
                    for intelligence, their mean IQ would be around 80 and the mean IQs of their
                    children around 84. The remaining 80 percent to 90 percent of the population who
                    had their children by embryo selection would have a mean IQ of about 110. By
                    using Embryo selection they could have children with IQs about 15 points higher
                    than their own, giving their children a mean IQ of around 125. Thus, in the
                    first generation there would be a difference of around 40 IQ points between the
                    average IQ of the embryo-selected and that of the unplanned. This gap would
                    increase by around 15 IQ points in each subsequent generation because the
                    embryo-selected would continue to have children whose IQs would be around 15 IQ
                    points higher than their own, while the IQs of the unplanned would remain the
                    same...”
                </p>
                <p>(It
                    sounds like the author is now arguing that a continuous increase in IQ would
                    occur. This contradicts his earlier claim, referenced on 152 – 153, that “In the
                    case of intelligence, there would not be any increase in the highest
                    intelligence hitherto achieved…This is because all the right genes and the most
                    favorable environmental conditions have already appeared from time to time and
                    produced people like Pascal and Galton… The average intelligence level of the
                    population would be improved, just as the average running speed of thoroughbreds
                    has been improved; but there would be no increase of the highest IQs, just as
                    there has been no improvement in the running speeds of the fastest
                    thoroughbreds.”)<span>&nbsp; </span>
                </p>
                <p>“This would give the
                    embryo-selected children a huge advantage in schools, colleges, occupations, and
                    incomes…This will lead to the emergence of a caste society containing two
                    genetically differentiated castes – the embryo-selected and the unplanned. The
                    two castes will live in different areas, attend different schools and colleges,
                    and hardly meet socially. They will normally marry and mate only within their
                    own group, transmitting their differentiated sets of genes to their children.
                    Virtually all the professional, white-collar, and skilled jobs would be
                    performed by the embryo-selected. Some of the unplanned would work in unskilled
                    and undemanding jobs, but many of them would be unemployed and unemployable.
                    These would be a genetic underclass…They would be a social problem, just as
                    their parents and grandparents of the old underclass were; and they would live
                    in a ghettoized underworld of chronic unemployment, crime, drug addiction,
                    single motherhood, and welfare dependency. Eventually, despite strong
                    ideological opposition, it would come to be understood that the underclass of
                    the unplanned was primarily a genetic problem and would require genetic
                    interventions.”

                <p>“The most favorable
                    attitudes toward eugenics were found among geneticists and physicians in China,
                    where the political leaders also favor eugenics and have already begun to
                    implement eugenic programs…In 1993 the Chinese government passed the Eugenics
                    and Health Protection Law, which prohibited the marriage of people with mental
                    illness, venereal diseases, and hepatitis with the express intention of
                    preventing them from having children. A further Act of 1994 authorized the
                    compulsory sterilization of the mentally retarded and of those with serious
                    genetic diseases and disorders, the mandatory prenatal testing of pregnant
                    women, and compulsory abortion in cases where a disorder is identified. These

                <p>“Authoritarian states intent
                    on implementing eugenics are likely to introduce both the classical eugenics of
                    selective reproduction and the new eugenics of the human biotechnologies. In
                    regard to classical eugenics, they would be expected to introduce programs for
                    the sterilization of the mentally retarded and of criminals and psychopaths.
                    These may well be carried out on a more robust scale than was attempted in the
                    Western democracies in the early and middle decades of the twentieth
                    century...They would also be expected to introduce some form of parental
                    licensing scheme of the kind discussed in Chapter 14. To make this effective and
                    to prevent the birth of unlicensed babies, we can envision that all 12-year-old
                    girls would be required to be fitted with contraception.
                </p>
                <p>There have already been
                    calls for this to be done in some of the Western democracies as a means of
                    preventing teenage pregnancies by irresponsible young women. For instance, in
                    Britain, John Guillebaud, medical director of the Margaret Pyke Family Planning
                    Center in London, made this proposal in February 1990: ‘In the future, and as a
                    social policy, when you have an area with a huge rate of teenage pregnancies,
                    you could go into a school, obviously with the consent of the parents, and fit
                    this device so that everybody would start out not being able to have a baby.’
                    The same scheme is implicit in the American psychologist David Lykken’s proposal
                    for licenses for parenthood, because the only feasible way of enforcing the
                    proposal would be to make it compulsory for young girls to be fitted with
                    long-term contraception, which could be removed once the license for parenthood
                    had been obtained.”

                    two strategies by which it is likely that this would be attempted. These are by
                    the provision of financial incentives and by promoting the concept that elites
                    have an ethical obligation to society to have children. The financial incentives
                    for having and rearing children could be made very considerable because

                    take courses in eugenics, such as were given in a number of U.S. universities in
                    the 1920s and 1930s, and based on the model of the courses in Marxism-Leninism
                    that were compulsory for students in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during
                    the years of communist rule. These courses would be designed to imbue the young
                    elite with a sense of the eugenic mission of the state and of their own

                    is probable because virtually all governments have the enhancement of their
                    national strength as one of their principal objectives. Political leaders
                    understand that the quality of their populations is a significant factor in
                    national strength, and they normally seek to enhance the quality of their

                    abilities, and moral standards.”

                <p>(The only reason rulers want to “enhance national
                    strength” is because, by
                    extension, it enhances their own strength. If rulers see an educated class as a
                    <em>threat</em> to their power, like the Khmer
                    Rouge did in Cambodia, it will slaughter them. You could argue that rulers might

                    that does not translate to the population at large. For authoritarians, an

                    “judges and juries” ever returned “perverse verdicts favoring their own racial”
                    group? I’m not justifying corruption; just pointing out that the handful of
                    “Bronx-jury” cases that you can dig up will certainly pale in comparison to the
                    number of cases where minorities have experienced the same injustice. For some
                    reason, I don’t think the author has given equal thought to the counter
                    example.)
                </p>
                <p>“Some people have predicted
                    that as the quality of life for whites and Asians deteriorates, interracial
                    conflicts will become so severe that they will lead to civil wars between
                    different racial groups and the eventual breakup of the United States into
                    racially homogenous independent states…A more likely scenario is that the United
                    States will continue as one country, become increasingly Hispanicized, and come
                    to resemble the Hispanic republics of Latin America. As this happens, the United
                    States will experience growing lawlessness, political anarchy, racial conflict,
                    and huge disparities in wealth between rich and poor…However the details of the
                    decline of the United States work out, it will forfeit its position as the
                    leading world economic, scientific, and military power and eventually cease to
                    be a major force in global politics.”

                        Eugenics in Asia:</span></p>
                <p>“There are [multiple]
                    reasons for anticipating [sophisticated eugenics programs in East Asia.] The
                    political leaders and the peoples of these countries do not share the high
                    priority accorded to individual rights at the expense of social rights that
                    developed during the second half of the twentieth century in Western nations and
                    that has been principally responsible for the rejection of eugenics. Throughout
                    East Asia there is a greater acceptance of the legitimacy of social rights,
                    which provide the political and ethical legitimacy for eugenics…The political
                    rulers of Singapore and China had already introduced eugenic programs in the
                    last two decades of the twentieth century, suggesting a willingness to implement
                    further eugenic measures…
                </p>
                <p>The political leaders of at
                    least some of these countries are likely to have the political will to implement
                    serious eugenic programs. This is suggested by the draconian one-child policy
                    introduced in China in 1979, which stipulated that couples were only permitted
                    to have one child. This edict was enforced by the compulsory fitting of IUDs,
                    compulsory abortions, and, as a further deterrent, the imposition of heavy fines
                    amounting to approximately half of annual earnings for couples having a second
                    child. At the same time, couples complying with the policy were given rewards in
                    the form of cash payments and better housing, food rations, and child health
                    care.
                </p>
                <p>By the early 1990s these
                    policies had reduced the total fertility rate in China to 1.9. A state that
                    succeeds in imposing population policies of this kind should not have any
                    difficulty in introducing programs of both classical eugenics and the new
                    eugenics of the human biotechnologies.”
                </p>
                <p>(Hooray for China. Maybe they can drop their fertility
                    rate all the way down to
                    “1.” At that point, producing less than half of the number of human beings
                    needed to sustain their population, they can experience a whole new set of
                    problems.)

                <p>“As China gains supremacy
                    over Europe in economic, scientific, and military strength sometime in the
                    second half of the twenty-first century, China can be expected to use its power
                    to take control of the world and establish a world state…
                </p>
                <p>Once China has developed a
                    superior military capability, it will probably not be necessary to use this to
                    establish world domination. The mere threat of its use should be sufficient to
                    coerce the rest of the world into submission. If, however, some stubborn states
                    refused to be coerced, it would become necessary to use some of these weapons on
                    those countries to demonstrate their effectiveness and to enforce submission, in
                    the same way as the United States dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima and
                    Nagasaki to force the surrender of Japan in 1945. One or two examples of this
                    kind should be sufficient to coerce the world into acceptance of Chinese
                    authority…
                </p>
                <p>The Chinese world state
                    would not permit the manufacture or possession of weapons, except by its own
                    peoples or by others under strict supervision. These weapons would be used to
                    supply the military detachments that it would maintain throughout its colonies
                    to suppress insurrection that would be likely to erupt from time to time. Apart
                    from these minor confrontations, there would be world peace. This will bring to
                    an end the long period of warfare between independent nation states and will be
                    one of the benefits of the world state.
                </p>
                <p>The Chinese oligarchy would
                    be expected to retain its autocratic character. It would realize that it would
                    be impossible to run a world state as a democracy. If a democratic constitution
                    were established, with countries given independence and voting powers along the
                    lines of the United Nations, the oligarchy controlling the world state would
                    find itself outvoted. It would be deprived of its authority, and the independent
                    countries would form coalitions to promote their own self-interest. The
                    oligarchy would see no reason to allow this to happen and to forego the
                    advantages gained from having secured world power. It would view democracy as an
                    experiment that was tried by Europeans for a century or so and failed. It would
                    learn this lesson of history and would not regard the democratic experiment as
                    worth repeating.”

                <p>(Bravo. We finally arrive at the truth which is that
                    none of this ever had
                    <em>anything</em> to do with so-called “social
                    rights.” It’s about having a handful of rulers impose their will, against the
                    wishes and <em>rights</em> of “society,” on a
                    global scale. The ruling oligarchy will decide what it wants and the rest of the
                    world will obey; <em>world peace</em>, indeed.)

                    intelligence, the European peoples have a greater capacity for creative
                    achievement, probably arising from a higher level of psychopathic personality,
                    enabling them more easily to challenge existing ways of thinking and to produce
                    creative innovations. This will be part of human genetic diversity that the

                <p>(The author states this as if he actually knows it’s
                    true. Based on what? Nobody
                    can possibly know what might transpire during a move for eugenic global
                    domination. Why should a Chinese oligarchy be expected to place
                    <em>any</em> value on the lives of the “inferior” enemy in the conflict?
                    Unless the Chinese are simply puppets, secretly controlled by the existing
                    Anglo-American elite power structure, I see no reason why they would allow

                <p>“China will continue its
                    rapid economic development and will emerge as a new superpower in the early
                    middle decades of the twenty-first century. Chinese economic, scientific, and
                    military strength is likely to be increased by further development of the
                    eugenic programs introduced in the 1980s and 1990s and particularly by the
                    introduction of the new eugenics of embryo selection and the cloning of elites.
                    As the power of the United States declines, China and Europe will emerge as the
                    two superpowers. A global conflict will develop between them in which Europe
                    will become progressively weakened by dysgenic forces and China progressively
                    strengthened by eugenic programs.
                </p>
                <p>This conflict will
                    eventually be won by China, which will use its power to assume control of the
                    world and to establish a world state. This event will become known as ‘the end
                    of history.’ Once China has established a world state, it can be expected to
                    administer this on the same lines as former colonial empires by appointing
                    Chinese governors and senior military and administrative support staff in charge
                    of the provinces of its world empire or by allowing nationals of its subject
                    peoples to administer the provinces under Chinese supervision. The establishment
                    of a Chinese world state will inevitably not be welcomed by the peoples of the
                    rest of the world, who will become colonized populations governed by an
                    oligarchy based in Beijing. There will be no democracy, and a number of freedoms
                    will be curtailed, including the freedom to publish seditious material and to
                    have unlimited numbers of children…
                </p>
                <p>This scenario for the
                    twenty-first century, in which China assumes world domination and establishes a
                    world eugenic state, may well be considered an unattractive future. But this is
                    not really the point. Rather, it should be regarded as the inevitable result of
                    Francis Galton’s (1909) prediction…that ‘the nation which first subjects itself
                    to a rational eugenical discipline is bound to inherit the earth.’”
