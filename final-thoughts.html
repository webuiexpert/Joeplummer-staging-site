                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                    In May 2012 I began sorting through and organizing the reference material for this book. After a
                    couple
                    months of narrowing my choices, I came to a reasonably depressing conclusion: there was absolutely
                    no way I could adequately condense Quigley's work into just
                    a couple hundred pages, let alone condense the Network-coordinated depravity
                    exposed in the dozens of other excellent books<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>
                    that I wanted to cover.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By August 2012, it looked like a bomb had gone off in our house; notes and books were strewn
                    everywhere, and
                    counted among the scraps of paper were countless abandoned outlines. With no
                    idea where to begin, and facing thousands of hours of additional work, I nearly
                    put everything away. I'd convinced myself that my best effort would only come up
                    short, so why bother? Ironically, one of the many topics that I knew I couldn't
                    adequately cover, summarized in a couple sentences that I'd scribbled on a piece
                    of paper, started moving me (psychologically) back in the right direction:
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>How many of us do <em>nothing</em> because we feel that we cannot do enough?</p>
                    <p>How much "more than enough" could be done if all of us simply did <em>something</em>?</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    These two sentences led me to reevaluate the <em>reason</em> for writing this
                    book. So what if I couldn't "adequately" summarize all of the material that I
                    wanted to cover? Even an <em>inadequate</em> summary would be better than no summary at all. And was
                    this
                    <em>really</em> about writing a condensed version of a thirteen-hundred-page history book, or was it
                    more about protecting
                    myself and others from men who believe "there is no moral dimensionâ€¦what is
                    successful is right"? Clearly it was the latter, and this is what ultimately
                    drove me to continue: a burning desire to expose and weaken the criminal ruling
                    class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point, I can only hope that you share my desire and that you feel the information you've
                    read here is
                    useful. If so, I would ask that you point people to the free online version of
                    this text available at TragedyAndHope.INFO, or if you have a hard copy, share it
                    with friends and family. Take a few minutes and leave a review at Amazon.com and
                    other websites, or simply recommend the book on message boards if the topic is a
                    good match. Never underestimate the impact you can have each time that you do
                    something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On my end, I will be creating a "bonus material" section at the TragedyAndHope.INFO website. This
                    will enable me
                    to post my page-reference notes for <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, as well as my notes for
                    <em>The Anglo-American Establishment</em>,
                    <em>Diplomacy</em>,
                    <em>NATO's Secret Armies,</em> and some of the
                    other books listed on the following page. Consider these page-reference notes a
                    collection of raw data that will help you quickly find interesting reference
                    material within each book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will also provide some links to excellent articles like "The Horrifying American Roots of Nazi
                    Eugenics"
                    available here <a href="http://hnn.us/article/1796" target="_blank">http://hnn.us/article/1796</a>.
                    From there I can post related information, like how the
                    <em>government</em> (following a 1974 policy report directed by Henry
                    Kissinger) implemented a secret twenty-five-year plan to reduce global
                    fertility,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>
                    or how the Network, in cooperation with the "government," created genetically
                    modified corn that was designed to sterilize those who ate it and a "tetanus"
                    vaccine designed to sterilize those who received the shot.<a href="#fn3"
                        class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    These and other topics were too much to squeeze between the covers of this book. Therefore, the
                    bonus-material
                    section will provide interested readers an opportunity to dig deeper into the
                    Network's long list of unpunished crimes. And on that note, if you're ready to
                    start digging now, here are just a handful of books that address the Network's
                    illegitimate power in one way or another. Many of them are available for free
                    online. I've listed them by page count from shortest to longest.
                </p>

                        <strong>Spermicidal corn</strong>: In September 2001 Epicyte reported that they had successfully
                        created the
                        ultimate GMO cropâ€”contraceptive corn. On October 6, 2002, CBS News reported that the United
                        States
                        Department of Agriculture had financed thirty-two field trials including Epicyte's spermicidal
                        corn. What was not revealed
                        was that the USDA was also providing the field trial results to
                        scientists at the US Department of Defense through one of their
                        biological research laboratories. At the time of their brief public
                        announcement, which they presented as a contribution to the world's "overpopulation" problem,
                        Epicyte estimated
                        its spermicidal corn would be available in 2006 or 2007. After the press
                        release, discussion of the breakthrough vanished. Nothing more was heard
                        in any media about the development.
                        <strong>Antifertility vaccines</strong>: The folks at the Rockefeller Foundation, in cooperation
                        with World Health
                        Organization researchers, sought to develop a double-whammy vaccine. In
                        the early 1990s, according to a report from the Global Vaccine
                        Institute, the World Health Organization oversaw massive vaccination
                        campaigns against tetanus in Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines. Numerous vials of the
                        vaccine, tested under
                        suspicion, were found to contain hCG, which, when combined with a tetanus toxoid carrier,
                        renders women
                        incapable of maintaining a pregnancy. Also, rather curiously, this
                        vaccination campaign against "tetanus" was directed only at women of
                        child-bearing ages between fifteen and forty-five. (The men and boys
                        apparently didn't need tetanus protection.) "Pro Vida dug further and
                        learned that the Rockefeller Foundationâ€¦the World Bank, the UN
                        Development Program and the Ford Foundation, and others had been working
                        with the World Health Organization for 20 years to develop an
                        anti-fertility vaccine using hCG with tetanus as well as other
                        vaccines." None of the women who received the hCG-laced vaccines were
                        told of the vaccine's abortive properties or its long-term effect on
                        their ability to have children.
