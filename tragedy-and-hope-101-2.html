                    </div>

                    <p>As already mentioned, Quigley wasn't your run-of-the-mill historian. Unlike most respected
                        academics, he wasn't afraid to talk about secret <em>conspirators</em> exercising power from the
                        shadows. Nor was he afraid to point out that constitutions, parliaments, presidents, and
                        emperors can all be used as a distraction, to divert attention away from the <em>real</em>
                        ruling power behind the throne. As just one example, at about 190 pages into <em>Tragedy and
                            Hope</em>, Quigley sets the record straight regarding the so-called Meiji Restoration in
                        Japan.</p>

                    <p>By all outward appearances, the Restoration wrested power away from the shogun and placed it back
                        in the hands of the Japanese emperor. But while this story of the emperor's return to power was
                        spread far and wide, the reality of the situation was quite different. In truth, the
                        <em>Restoration</em> had simply shifted power away from the shogun and into the hands of feudal
                        lords who "proceeded to rule Japan in the emperor's name and from the emperor's shadow."<a
                            href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a>
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>These leaders, organized in a shadowy group known as the Meiji oligarchy, had obtained
                            complete domination of Japan by 1889. <strong>To cover this fact with camouflage</strong>,
                            they unleashed a vigorous propaganda [of] abject submission to the emperor which culminated
                            in the extreme emperor worship of 1941–1945.</p>

                        <p>To provide an administrative basis for their rule, the oligarchy created an extensive
                            governmental bureaucracy…To provide an economic basis for their rule, this oligarchy used
                            their political influence to pay themselves extensive pensions and government grants [and
                            engaged] in corrupt business relationships with their allies in the commercial classes…To
                            provide a military basis for their rule, the oligarchy created a new imperial army and navy
                            and penetrated the upper ranks of these so that they were able to dominate these forces as
                            they dominated the civil bureaucracy. To provide a social basis for their rule, the
                            oligarchy created…five ranks of nobility recruited from their own members and supporters.
                        </p>

                        <p>Having thus assured their dominant position…the oligarchy in 1889 drew up a constitution
                            which would assure, and yet conceal, their political domination of the country.<a
                                href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The oligarchy presented the constitution as "an emission from the emperor, setting up a system in
                        which all government would be in his name, and all officials would be personally responsible to
                        him."<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a> This seemingly legitimate constitution
                        called for a legislative body composed of both an elected House of Representatives and a House
                        of Peers. Though these provisions were enacted, they were essentially meaningless:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The form and functioning of the constitution was of little significance, for the country
                            continued to be run by the Meiji oligarchy through their domination of the army and navy,
                            the bureaucracy, economic and social life, and the opinion-forming agencies such as
                            education and religion.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Like <em>all</em> ruling classes, the Meiji maintained control by indoctrinating the masses in an
                        ideology that served the oligarchs' interests. Specifically, they propagated the Shinto
                        ideology, which called for subordination to the emperor. "In this system, there was no place for
                        individualism, self-interest, human liberties, or civil rights."<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"
                            class="footnote">[5]</a></p>

                    <p>The Japanese people accepted this Shinto ideology, and as a result the Meiji oligarchy was able
                        to ruthlessly exploit them in the emperor's name. However, interestingly enough, the Meiji were
                        beholden to an even greater power. Behind them there existed yet another group, numbering no
                        more than a dozen men, which represented the ultimate ruling power in Japan. Quigley explains:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>These leaders came in time to form a formal, if extralegal, group known as the
                            <em>Genro</em>…Of this group, Robert Reischauer wrote in 1938: "It is these men who have
                            been the real power behind the Throne. It became customary for their opinion to be asked
                            and, more important still, to be followed in all matters of great significance to the
                            welfare of the state. No Premier was ever appointed except from the recommendation of these
                            men who became known as the <em>Genro</em>. Until 1922 no important domestic legislation, no
                            important foreign treaty escaped their perusal and sanction before it was signed by the
                            Emperor. These men, in their time, were the actual rulers of Japan."<a href="#fn6"
                                id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Nature of Secret Coercive Power</h2>

                    <p>There is a very logical reason why coercive power prefers secrecy and deception: if the goal is
                        to exploit and dominate others (without suffering the natural consequences of doing so), then
                        transparency and honesty are not an option. As such, the basic <em>template</em> of coercive
                        power (often hidden, always deceptive, and exercised in the name of something other than itself)
                        is common throughout history. If "the name of God" is beyond reproach, then intelligent rulers
                        will exercise their power in the name of God. If invoking the name of <em>democracy</em>, or the
                        <em>state</em>, or the <em>emperor</em> will empower them, they will act in the name of any of
                        these. This <em>is</em> the unchanging characteristic of those who effectively rule the masses:
                        they will <em>say</em> and <em>do</em> anything to establish a system that serves their
                        interests.
                    </p>

                    <p>Stated another way: <em>morality</em> will never stop an individual or group that's willing to
                        lie, steal, intimidate, imprison, torture, or kill in pursuit of their aims. Likewise, a piece
                        of paper with words written on it (a constitution) and an easily manipulated democratic form of
                        government will not stop them either. This latter point is particularly relevant today because
                        the "opinion-forming agencies" have done everything in their power to convince us otherwise.</p>

                    <p>From a very early age, we are conditioned to believe that a constitution and democratic elections
                        somehow prove that <em>we</em> are in control; that those who would seek illegitimate power over
                        our lives cannot succeed with these protections in place. We are never asked to question whether
                        this belief is actually <em>true</em>. We are never provided examples that might suggest that it
                        is not true. For instance, did Stalinist Russia's constitution and elections of "democratic
                        appearance and form"<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a> protect the people of
                        Russia? Did a government that was "democratic in form"<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"
                            class="footnote">[8]</a> prevent the rise of Hitler in Germany? Is the "Democratic People's
                        Republic" of North Korea, with its regular elections, a true republic? Were the Genro unable to
                        rule Japan as a result of the Japanese constitution and <em>elections</em>? Moving a bit closer
                        to home, what about the <strong>guaranteed</strong> protections outlined in the constitution of
                        the United States? Are these written protections sufficient to block the predations of an
                        illegitimate ruling class? If you think they are, consider the following:</p>

                    <p>Today, in the "freest nation on earth," US representatives have claimed the authority to spy on
                        US citizens without a warrant. This clearly violates the US Constitution. They have claimed the
                        authority to arrest citizens and hold them forever without charges and without the right to
                        challenge the legitimacy of their detention. This too violates the US Constitution. They have
                        even claimed the authority to <em>kill</em> US citizens based on nothing more than an
                        accusation…no judge, no jury, no public presentation of evidence or requirement to prove
                        guilt.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a> This is an egregious violation of the
                        individual protections outlined in the US Constitution.</p>

                    <p>Since US citizens never granted their representatives the authority to violate these legal
                        restrictions on government power, these powers must have been seized. <em>Rulers</em> seize
                        power; <em>representatives</em> do not. As noted in chapter 1, Quigley referred to these rulers
                        as the "experts" who will replace "the democratic voter in control of the political system."</p>

                    <p>Here is where arguments about the inevitable destruction of national sovereignty really take
                        root. In the eyes of the <em>experts</em>, it is merely a matter of time before one superior
                        group of rulers finally achieves what all prior rulers have attempted (sufficient power to
                        <em>compel obedience</em> over all areas of the globe). Quigley explains the progression of
                        global coercive power this way:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The increasing offensive power of the Western weapons systems has made it possible to compel
                            obedience over wider and wider areas and over larger numbers of peoples. Accordingly,
                            political organizations (such as the state)…have become larger in size and fewer in
                            numbers…In this way, the political development of Europe over the last millennium has seen
                            thousands of feudal areas coalesce into hundreds of principalities, and these into scores of
                            dynastic monarchies, and, finally, into a dozen or more national states. The national state,
                            its size measured in hundreds of miles [was possible only because it could] apply force over
                            hundreds of miles.</p>

                        <p>As the technology of weapons, transportation, communications, and propaganda continued to
                            develop, it became possible to compel obedience over areas measured in thousands (rather
                            than hundreds) of miles and thus over distances greater than those occupied by existing
                            linguistic and cultural groups. It thus became necessary to appeal for allegiance to the
                            state on grounds wider than nationalism. This gave rise, in the 1930's and 1940's, to the
                            idea of continental blocs and the ideological state (replacing the national state).<a
                                href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The consolidation that Quigley describes is more than a collection of historical facts. It
                        captures the immutable nature of coercive power. Unchecked, rulers will <em>always</em>
                        consolidate and centralize their control until there is nothing left for them to seize. And,
                        unfortunately, this applies to human freedom as well as geographic resources: "One step leads to
                        another, and every acquisition obtained to protect an earlier acquisition requires a new advance
                        at a later date to protect it."<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>

                    <p>So, accepting this reality, we wind up with a handful of important questions: Who are the rulers?
                        To what extent can they "compel obedience" without meaningful resistance? How did they seize
                        power? How do they maintain and expand their power? What are their unpunished crimes (past and
                        present)? Most importantly, what are the strategic targets that we must strike to destroy their
                        illegitimate rule? In the following chapters, we'll cover all of this and more. But first, we
                        must begin at the beginning.</p>

                        psychological sciences, and business, Oxford has a very long and distinguished history. It has
                        produced dozens of prime ministers. It has produced archbishops, saints, famous economists like
                        Adam Smith, and famous writers like R.R. Tolkien (<em>Lord of the Rings</em>) and Aldous Huxley
                        (<em>Brave New World</em>) as well as philosophers like Thomas Hobbs and John Locke. Oxford also
                        produced, approximately one hundred and fifty years ago, the progenitors of <em>the
                            Network</em>. Let's flash back to this time in history, circa 1860.</p>

                    <p>Two opposing forces in the British Empire are clashing heads. On one side, many are arguing that
                        the empire is immoral, expensive, and unnecessary. This argument, championed by men like William
                        Gladstone, is eroding support for Britain's imperial policies. On the other side of the argument
                        stands Benjamin Disraeli. Disraeli, a close ally of the queen, is a harsh critic of Gladstone
                        and other "Little Englanders" who dare to challenge the benefits and necessity of the empire.
                        Having referred to Gladstone as "God's only mistake," the intense rivalry between Disraeli and
                        Gladstone is legendary. The following provides one example of their many disagreements:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Disraeli and Gladstone clashed over Britain's Balkan policy…Disraeli believed in upholding
                            Britain's greatness through a tough, "no nonsense" foreign policy that put Britain's
                            interests above the "moral law" that advocated emancipation of small nations. Gladstone,
                            however, saw the issue in moral terms: the Turks had massacred Bulgarian Christians and
                            Gladstone therefore believed it was immoral to support the Ottoman Empire.<a href="#fn13"
                                id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Because Gladstone's moral arguments were gaining ground, a new institute was formed to counter
                        the rising tide of anti-imperialism. Quigley writes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The Royal Colonial Institute was founded in 1868 to fight the "Little England" idea; Disraeli
                            as prime minister (1874–1880) dramatized the profit and glamour of empire by such acts as
                            the purchase of control of the Suez Canal and by granting Queen Victoria the title of
                            Empress of India; after 1870 it became increasingly evident that, however expensive colonies
                            might be to a government, they could be fantastically profitable to individuals and
                            companies supported by such governments.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14"
                                class="footnote">[14]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>And so, to protect the profits of Britain's imperial policies, the rhetoric used to justify
                        imperialism slowly began to change. One man, appointed to a newly created professorship at
                        Oxford, led the charge in teaching Oxford undergraduates the "new imperialism."</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The new imperialism after 1870 was quite different in tone from that which the Little
                            Englanders had opposed earlier. The chief changes were that it was justified on grounds of
                            moral duty and of social reform and not, as earlier, on grounds of missionary activity and
                            material advantage. The man most responsible for this change was John Ruskin.</p>

                        <p>Ruskin spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the privileged, ruling class. He told
                            them that they were the possessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of
                            law, freedom, decency and self-discipline but that this tradition could not be saved, and
                            did not deserve to be saved, unless it could be extended to the lower classes in England
                            itself and to the non-English masses throughout the world. If this precious tradition were
                            not extended to these two great majorities, the minority of upper-class Englishmen would
                            ultimately be submerged by these majorities and the tradition lost.<a href="#fn15"
                                id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Based on these new justifications, the same immoral policies of conquest and subjugation found
                        new support. The empire was now not only a matter of moral duty; it was a matter of
                        self-preservation. (If the ruling elite failed to expand the empire, their civilized way of life
                        would be lost to the unwashed masses.) It was a powerful message, and it had a "sensational
                        impact" on one of Ruskin's students. The student was so moved that he copied Ruskin's lecture
                        word for word and kept it with him for thirty years.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16"
                            class="footnote">[16]</a> He also, with a handful of other Ruskin devotees, went on to
                        establish and fund the Network that Quigley referred to as "one of the most important historical
                        facts of the twentieth century."<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a> The
                        student's name was Cecil Rhodes.</p>

                    <p>If you've heard of Cecil Rhodes, odds are it hasn't been within the context of him being "that
                        guy who created a secret society to control the world." However, you may have heard of the
                        Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford (or maybe the term <em>Rhodes Scholar</em>, a title given to
                        students who studied under his program).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a>
                        Maybe you've heard of the African nation of Rhodesia, or Rhodes University located in South
                        Africa, both named after Rhodes. If you've ever bought a diamond, perhaps you've heard of the De
                        Beers diamond company (a South African diamond monopoly, established by Rhodes).</p>

                    <p>Each of these stands as a testament to the extraordinary life and influence of Cecil Rhodes. But
                        the most significant thing Rhodes established during his lifetime doesn't bear his name and
                        remains almost completely unknown. This despite the fact that the secret society he founded in
                        1891,<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a> and its subsequent "instruments,"
                        continues to operate to this day.</p>

                    <h2>Building the Network</h2>

                    <p>Rhodes extracted much of the original funding for his secret society from the diamond and gold
                        mines of South Africa. After monopolizing these industries, the enormous wealth and influence
                        that he secured enabled him to steadily increase the Network's reach. Quigley explains:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Rhodes feverishly exploited the diamond and goldfields of South Africa, rose to be Prime
                            Minister of the Cape Colony (1890–1896), contributed money to political parties, controlled
                            parliamentary seats both in England and in South Africa, and sought to win a strip of
                            British territory across Africa from the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt.<a href="#fn20"
                                id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Not surprisingly, Rhodes didn't feel any moral conflict about his imperial desires or the methods
                        that he used to attain them. He viewed himself as superior to those he intended to subjugate. In
                        his last will and testament, he wrote:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>I contend that we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit
                            the better it is for the human race. Just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by
                            the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were
                            brought under Anglo-Saxon influence.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote">[21]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>A PBS series titled <em>Queen Victoria's Empire</em> credits Rhodes with inspiring a burst of
                        "imperialistic fervor" in Britain. Near the end of the piece, it says of Rhodes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Cecil John Rhodes…became the greatest empire builder of his generation. To fund his dreams of
                            conquest, he embarked on a ruthless pursuit of diamonds, gold and power that made him the
                            most formidable and the most hated man in Africa.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>But this story is much bigger than the effect Cecil Rhodes had on Africa or British Imperialism
                        over a century ago. Obviously, to properly tell the story of the Network, a handful of important
                        individuals like Rhodes <em>do</em> need to be mentioned. However, to be clear, these
                        individuals are not the main focus of this story. Instead, our focus will fall mainly on the
                        instruments that Rhodes and his followers created or infiltrated, as well as the tactics they
                        employed to secretly further their goals. (As powerful as any one individual might have been or
                        currently is within the Network, the <em>instruments</em> and <em>tactics</em> are where the
                        real power lies. Men eventually die; instruments and tactics can live on indefinitely.)</p>

                            <p>Of Lord Salisbury's five sons, the oldest (now fourth Marquess of Salisbury), was in
                                almost every Conservative government from 1900 to 1929. He had four children, of whom
                                two married into the Cavendish family. Of these, a daughter, Lady Mary Cecil, married in
                                1917 the Marquess of Hartington, later tenth Duke of Devonshire; the older son, Viscount
                                Cranborne, married Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, niece of the ninth Duke of Devonshire. The
                                younger son, Lord David Cecil, a well-known writer of biographical works, was for years
                                a Fellow of Wadham and for the last decade has been a Fellow of New College. The other
                                daughter, Lady Beatrice Cecil, married W. G. A. OrmsbyGore (now Lord Harlech), who
                                became a member of the Milner Group. It should perhaps be mentioned that Viscount
                                Cranborne was in the House of Commons from 1929 to 1941 and has been in the House of
                                Lords since. He was Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in 1935–1938, resigned in
                                protest at the Munich agreement, but returned to office in 1940 as Paymaster General
                                (1940), Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (1940–1942), and Colonial Secretary
                                (1942). He was later Lord Privy Seal (1942–1943), Secretary for Dominion Affairs again
                                (1943–1945), and Leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Lords (1943–1945).<a

                    <h2>The Network's First Instrument and Some of Its Accomplishments</h2>

                    <p>The first instrument created by Rhodes and his associates was the secret society itself. After
                        seventeen years of planning,<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a> Rhodes called
                        a meeting and formally established the society. Inspired by the Jesuits,<a href="#fn24"
                            id="fnref24" class="footnote">[24]</a> the Illuminati,<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25"
                            class="footnote">[25]</a> and the Freemasons (of which he was a member),<a href="#fn26"
                            id="fnref26" class="footnote">[26]</a> Rhodes hoped to succeed where the other secret
                        societies had failed. Using a "rings within rings" structure, the center ring of power (composed
                        of Rhodes and just three other individuals) would control all of the outer rings. Of the three
                        individuals who shared the inner ring with Rhodes, Alfred Milner (later awarded the title
                        <em>Lord</em> Milner) became the strongest.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The goals which Rhodes and Milner sought and the methods by which they hoped to achieve them
                            were so similar by 1902 that the two are almost indistinguishable. Both sought to unite the
                            world…in a federal structure around Britain. Both felt that this goal could best be achieved
                            by a secret band of men united to one another by devotion to the common cause…Both felt that
                            this band should pursue its goal <strong>by secret political and economic influence behind
                                the scenes and by the control of journalistic, educational, and propaganda
                                agencies.</strong></p>

                        <p>With the death of Rhodes in 1902, Milner obtained control of Rhodes's money and was able to
                            use it to lubricate the workings of his propaganda machine. This is exactly as Rhodes had
                            wanted and had intended. Milner was Rhodes's heir, and both men knew it…In 1898…Rhodes said,
                            "I support Milner absolutely without reserve. If he says peace, I say peace; if he says war,
                            I say war. Whatever happens, I say ditto to Milner."<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27"

                    <p>Always on the lookout for potential helpers, Milner recruited mainly from Oxford and Toynbee
                        Hall. He used his influence to place the new recruits into positions of power.</p>

                            tests, they were gradually admitted to the Milner Group's great fiefs such as the Royal
                            Institute of International Affairs, <em>The Times</em>, <em>The Round Table</em>, or, on the
                            larger scene, to the ranks of the Foreign or Colonial Offices.<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30"

                    <p>This system proved to be very effective. It allowed the growing Network to remain hidden, while
                        its founders exercised a level of control that can "hardly be exaggerated." As proof, Quigley
                        provides a partial list of the group's so-called accomplishments. Among them:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Second Boer War (1899–1902)</li>
                        <li>The partitioning of Ireland, Palestine, and India</li>
                        <li>Formation and management of the League of Nations</li>
                        <li>British "appeasement" policy (empowerment policy) of Hitler</li>
                        <li>Control of <em>The Times</em>, Oxford, and those who write "the history of British Imperial
                            and foreign policy"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Quigley goes on to say:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It would be expected that a Group which could number among its achievements such
                            accomplishments as these would be a familiar subject for discussion among students of
                            history…In this case, the expectation is not realized.<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31"

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Something else that is "not realized" when dispassionately rattling off a list of
                        "accomplishments" like those above is the true gravity and life-altering impact of those events.
                        To provide a little perspective, we'll briefly cover one of the aforementioned accomplishments
                        here. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so let's start with a picture of just
                        <em>one</em> of the thousands of children (Lizzie Van Zyl) who starved to death in British
                        concentration camps during the Second Boer War.

                    <h2>The Second Boer War</h2>

                    <p>Rhodes, as a member of "the finest race in the world," needed money to fund his global-domination
                        project. To obtain that money, he had no problem seizing valuable resources from the "despicable
                        specimens of human beings" that it rightfully belonged to. As such, he used his dominant
                        influence over British Imperial policy (the ability to direct British military force) against
                        the Boers in South Africa.</p>

                    <p>It should be noted that his first attempt to grab Boer land and resources, a conspiracy known as
                        the Jameson Raid, failed miserably. And though he and his Network had clearly directed the
                        conspiracy and though the leaders he selected to overthrow the Boer government were caught in
                        the act, the consequences of the attempted coup weren't sufficient to prevent a more ambitious
                        conspiracy (the Second Boer War) that followed a few years later.</p>

                    <div class="side-note">
                        <p><strong>Side Note</strong>: Cecil's brother, Frank Rhodes, was among the leaders who were
                            captured and tried by the Boer government for the Jameson Raid.<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32"
                                class="footnote">[32]</a> If there are any doubts about the benefits of being among the
                            ruling class, this should settle the issue:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>For conspiring with Dr. Jameson…members of the Reform Committee…were tried in the
                                Transvaal courts and found guilty of high treason. The four leaders were sentenced to
                                death by hanging, but this sentence was next day commuted to 15 years' imprisonment; and
                                in June 1896 [six months later] the other members of the Committee were released on
                                payment of £2,000 each in fines, all of which were paid by Cecil Rhodes.</p>

                            <p>Jan C. Smuts wrote in 1906, "The Jameson Raid was the real declaration of war…And that is
                                so in spite of the four years of truce that followed…[the] aggressors consolidated their
                                alliance…the defenders on the other hand silently and grimly prepared for the
                                inevitable."<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a></p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>

                    <p>In the years following the failed Jameson Raid, the Network began agitating for British
                        annexation of the Boer Republics. After a sufficient British military buildup and failed
                        negotiations, the inevitable finally came. Paul Kruger (known as the "face of Boer resistance"<a
                            href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote">[34]</a>) saw that war was unavoidable and issued
                        a final ultimatum to the British, demanding that they withdraw all troops from the borders of
                        the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State within forty-eight hours.<a href="#fn35"
                            id="fnref35" class="footnote">[35]</a> If the British refused, the two republics would
                        declare war.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Outrage and laughter were the main responses. The editor of <em>The Times</em> laughed out
                            loud when he read it, saying "an official document is seldom amusing and useful yet this was
                            both." <em>The Times</em> denounced the ultimatum as an "extravagant farce." <em>The
                                Globe</em> denounced this "trumpery little state." Most editorials were similar to the
                            <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, which declared: "of course there can only be one answer to this
                            grotesque challenge. Kruger has asked for war and war he must have!"<a href="#fn36"
                                id="fnref36" class="footnote">[36]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>And war they did have, with all of the injustice and brutality that one should expect: theft,
                        subjugation, suffering, and murder. Though the Network and its supporters expected a fast and
                        easy victory over the "trumpery little" states that dared to challenge the British Empire, such
                        was not the case. The Boers were skilled hunters and competent fighters. As weeks turned into
                        months, and months turned into years, the Boers (determined to regain the independence of their
                        own territory) drove the British to employ a scorched-earth policy.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, burned
                            homesteads and farms, poisoned wells, and interned Boer and African women, children and
                            workers in concentration camps.</p>

                        <p>The Boer War concentration camp system was the first time that a whole nation had been
                            systematically targeted, and the first in which some whole regions had been depopulated.</p>

                        <p>Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of
                            thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration
                            camps.<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote">[37]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Ultimately, the concentration camp system proved more deadly than the battlefield. By war's end,
                        nearly 50 percent of all Boer children under sixteen years of age had "died of starvation,
                        disease and exposure in the concentration camps." All told, approximately 25 percent of the Boer
                        inmate population died, and total civilian deaths in the camps (mostly women and children)
                        reached twenty-six thousand. (The picture of Lizzie Van Zyl represents just one of those
                        twenty-six thousand faces.)<a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote">[38]</a></p>

                    <p>Sadly, these numbers account for only Boer civilians killed. In all, the death toll of the Second
                        Boer War exceeded seventy thousand lives, with more than twenty-five thousand combatants killed
                        and an additional twenty thousand black Africans, 75 percent of whom died in the British
                        concentration camps. But, of course, this was only just the beginning and a small price to pay
                        for the Network. The defeated republics were absorbed into the empire and were eventually folded
                        into the Union of South Africa (also a creation of the Network, which served as a British ally
                        during the two World Wars).<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote">[39]</a></p>

                    <p>Hopefully, this short outline of the Second Boer War adds some depth to one of the early
                        "accomplishments" of Rhodes and his fellow conspirators. Factor in the immeasurable suffering of
                        some of their other so-called accomplishments, like the million or so who died when they decided
                        to partition India, or the millions more who died as a result of their Hitler-empowerment
                        project, and Quigley's assertion that this group is "one of the most important facts of the
                        twentieth century" is hard to deny.</p>

                    <p>As the British government suffered the political consequences of the Network's decisions, and as
                        the British citizenry and soldiers paid the costs in blood and treasure, the secret society that
                        Rhodes created was able to operate without fear of direct repercussions. The British government
                        was now one of its instruments. Oxford, <em>The Times</em>, the League of Nations, and the Royal
                        Institute for International Affairs (to name a few) were also its instruments. On the surface,
                        each of these appeared unconnected. Beneath the surface, each was dominated by the same group of
                        individuals.</p>

                    <p>In a rare moment of honest criticism, Quigley warns his readers:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>No country that values its safety should allow what the Milner Group accomplished in
                            Britain—that is, that a small number of men should be able to wield such power in
                            administration and politics, should be given almost complete control over the publication of
                            the documents relating to their actions, should be able to exercise such influence over the
                            avenues of information that create public opinion.</p>

                        <p>Such power, whatever the goals at which it may be directed, is too much to be entrusted
                            safely to any group.<a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote">[40]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Building on that foundation, it's time now to shift away from the Network's impact on Europe,
                        Africa, and Asia. As interesting and tragic as those stories might be, there is another
                        continent (North America) that Rhodes intended to control from the start.</p>

                    <p>In his first will, Rhodes resolved to create a global power so great that it would "render wars
                        impossible." (More accurately, he should have stated: "Render <em>resistance</em> to the Network
                        impossible.") Not surprisingly, this goal to create an unconquerable global power required "the
                        ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire."<a
                            href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote">[41]</a></p>

                    <p>In the following chapter, we'll cover how the Network successfully infiltrated the political and
                        economic system of the United States and turned it into just another one of its instruments in
                        the quest for global domination.</p>

                            <p>[35] It's worth noting that Jan Smuts was President Kruger's main political advisor and
                                that <em>Smuts</em> wrote the ultimatum that made war inevitable. Why is this important?
                                Because Smuts was also a "vigorous supporter of Rhodes" and eventually became "one of
                                the most important members" of the Network. In other words, the Network had its agents
                                play both sides of the conflict, carefully guiding the British and South African nations
                                to war (<em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, page 137). <a href="#fnref35">↩</a></p>
