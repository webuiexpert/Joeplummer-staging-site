                        tell the story:</p>

                    <p>"Rhodes in five previous wills left his fortune to form a secret society, which was to devote
                        itself to the preservation and expansion of the British Empire. And what does not seem to be
                        known to anyone is that this secret society was created by Rhodes and his principal trustee,
                        Lord Milner, and continues to exist to this day…It is not easy for an outsider to write the
                        history of a secret group of this kind, but, since no insider is going to do it, an outsider
                        must attempt it. It should be done, for this Group is, as I shall show, one of the most
                        important historical facts of the twentieth century."</p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">XI:</span> Quigley agrees with their goals, not their methods:</p>

                    <p>"In general, I agree with the goals and aims of the Milner Group. I feel that the British way of
                        life and the British Commonwealth of Nations are among the great achievements of all
                        history…But, agreeing with the Group on goals, I cannot agree with them on methods. To be sure,
                        I realize that some of their methods were based on nothing but good intentions…But their lack of
                        perspective in critical moments, their failure to use intelligence and common sense…their
                        tendency to place power and influence into hands chosen by friendship rather than merit, their
                        oblivion to the consequences of their actions, their ignorance of the point of view of persons
                        in other countries or of persons in other classes in their own country – these things, it seems
                        to me, have brought many of the things which they and I hold dear close to disaster…I feel that
                        the truth has a right to be told, and, once told, can be an injury to no men of good will. Only
                        by a knowledge of the errors of the past is it possible to correct the tactics of the future."

                    <p><span class="page-ref">4-5:</span> Despite its power, the Network has been able to hide its
                        influence:</p>

                    <p>"This organization has been able to conceal its existence quite successfully and many of its most
                        influential members, satisfied to possess the reality rather than the appearance of power, are
                        unknown even to close students of British history. This is the more surprising when we learn
                        that one of the chief methods by which this Group works has been through propaganda. It plotted
                        the Jameson Raid of 1895; it caused the Boer War of 1899 – 1902; it set up and controls the
                        Rhodes Trust; it created the Union of South Africa in 1906 – 1910…it founded the British Empire
                        periodical <em>The Round Table</em> in 1910…it has been the most powerful single influence in
                        All Souls, Balliol, and New Colleges of Oxford for more than a generation; it has controlled
                        <em>The Times</em> for more than fifty years, with the exception of the three years 1919 – 1922;
                        it publicized the idea of and the name 'British Commonwealth of Nations' in the period 1908 –
                        1918; it was the chief influence in Lloyd George's war administration in 1917 – 1919 and
                        dominated the British delegation to the Peace Conference of 1919; it had a great deal to do with
                        the formation and management of the League of Nations and of the system of mandates; it founded
                        the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1919 and still controls it; it was one of the
                        chief influences on British policy toward Ireland, Palestine, and India in the period 1917 –
                        1945; it was a very important influence on the policy of appeasement of Germany during the years
                        1920 – 1940; and it controlled and still controls, to a very considerable extent, the sources
                        and the writing of the history of British Imperial and foreign policy since the Boer War…It
                        would be expected that a Group which could number among its achievements such accomplishments as
                        these would be a familiar subject for discussion among students of history and public affairs.
                        In this case, the expectation is not realized…"</p>

                    <p>"By 1916 the Milner Group had made its entrance into the citadel of political power and for the
                        next twenty-three years steadily extended its influence until, by 1938, it was the most potent
                        political force in Britain…The original members of the Milner Group came from well-to-do,
                        upper-class, frequently titled families…At first their family fortunes may have been adequate to
                        their ambitions, but in time these were supplemented by access to the funds in the foundation of
                        All Souls, the Rhodes Trust and the Beit Trust, the fortune of Sir Abe Bailey, the Astor
                        Fortune, certain powerful British banks (of which the chief was Lazard Brothers and Company),

                        the Cecil Bloc by matrimonial alliances and by gratitude for titles and positions of power; and
                        (c) the influencing of public policy by placing members of the Cecil Block in positions of power

                        the summit of power, but only disappointment if he falls short of the opportunities that are set

                    <p>"The realization is increased when we see that these persons with the power to obtain renewing
                        appointments are members of a shadowy group with common undergraduate associations, close
                        personal relationships, similar interests and ideas, and surprisingly similar biographical
                        experience. It is this shadowy group which includes the All Souls members of the Milner
                        Group…The Milner Group [has exercised its power] in regard to the seventeen ex-officio
                        fellowships, the ten Distinguished Persons fellowships, and the twelve reelective fellowships.
                        And it has also been important in contributing to the general direction and policy of the
                        college…This does not mean that the Milner Group is identical with All Souls, but merely that it
                        is the chief, if not the controlling, influence in it, especially in recent years." + "…the
                        writer was shrewd enough to see that an outside group dominates All Souls. He was also able to
                        see the link between All Souls and <em>The Times</em>, although quite mistaken in his conclusion
                        that the latter controls the former. As we shall see, the Milner Group dominates both."</p>

                        propaganda throughout the Empire, and the steps to be taken to pave the way for the foundation

                        the 'Closer Union Societies' and <em>The Round Table</em> replacing <em>The State</em>. But, as
                        befitted a larger problem, additional personnel and additional funds were required. The
                        additional personnel came largely from New College and All Souls; the additional funds came from
                        Cecil Rhodes and his associates and All Souls. The older sources of funds (like Abe Bailey) and
                        influence (like <em>The Times</em>) remained loyal to the Group and continued to assist in this
                        second great battle of the Milner Group."</p>

                        as it had been before 1903 for the Cecil Bloc. The inner circle of this Group, because of its
                        close contact with Oxford and with All Souls, was in a position to notice able young
                        undergraduates at Oxford. These were admitted to All Souls and at once given opportunities in
                        public life and in writing or teaching, to test their abilities and loyalty to the ideals of the
                        Milner Group. If they passed both of these tests, they were gradually admitted to the Milner
                        Group's great fiefs such as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, <em>The Times</em>,
                        <em>The Round Table</em>, or, on the larger scene, to the ranks of the Foreign or Colonial

                        Jameson Raid, months before the raid took place…She even suggested on several occasions that the

                        her news articles, Miss Shaw embraced the cause of the British in the Transvaal even to the
                        extent of exaggerating and falsifying their hardships under Boer rule. It was <em>The Times</em>
                        that published as an exclusive feature the famous (and fraudulent) 'women and children' letter,
                        dated 20 December 1895, which pretended to be an appeal for help from the persecuted British in

                        Jameson himself on 20 November and sent to Miss Shaw a month later. This letter was published by
                        <em>The Times</em> as soon as news of the Jameson' Raid was known, as a justification of the

                        people'</p>

                    <p>"The Milner Group…hoped to work on the opinions of the small group of 'important people,' who in
                        turn could influence wider and wider circles of persons. This was the basis on which the Milner
                        Group itself was constructed; it was the theory behind the Rhodes Scholarships; it was the
                        theory behind <em>The Round Table</em> and the Royal Institute of International Affairs; it was
                        the theory behind the efforts to control All Souls, New College, and Balliol and, through these
                        three, to control Oxford University; and it was the theory behind <em>The Times</em>.</p>

                    <p>No effort was made to win a large circulation for <em>The Times</em>, for, in order to obtain
                        such a circulation, it would have been necessary to make changes in the tone of the paper that
                        would have reduced its influence with the elite…<em>The Times</em> was to be a paper for the
                        people who are influential, and not for the masses. <em>The Times</em> was influential, but the
                        degree of its influence would never be realized by anyone who examined only the paper itself.
                        The greater part of its influence arose from its position as one of several branches of a single
                        group, the Milner Group. By the interaction of these various branches on one another,
                        <strong>under the pretense that each branch was an autonomous power</strong>, <strong>the
                            influence of each branch was increased through a process of mutual reinforcement</strong>.
                        The unanimity among the various branches was believed by the outside world to be the result of
                        the influence of a single Truth, while really it was the result of the existence of a single
                        group.</p>

                    <p>Thus, a statesman (a member of the Group) announces a policy. About the same time, the Royal
                        Institute of International Affairs [created and controlled by the Group] publishes a study on
                        the subject, and…a Fellow of All Souls (and a member of the Group) also publishes a volume on
                        the subject (probably through a publishing house, like G. Bell and Sons or Faber and Faber,
                        allied to the Group). The statesman's policy is subjected to critical analysis and final
                        approval in a 'leader' in <em>The Times</em>, while the two books are reviewed (in a single
                        review) in <em>The times Literary Supplement</em>. Both the 'leader' and the review are
                        anonymous but are written by members of the Group. And finally, at about the same time, an
                        anonymous article in <em>The Round Table</em> strongly advocates the same policy. The cumulative
                        effect of such tactics as this, even if each tactical move influences only a small number of
                        important people, is bound to be great. If necessary, the strategy can be carried further, by
                        arranging for the secretary to the Rhodes Trustees to go to America for a series of 'informal
                        discussions' with former Rhodes Scholars, while a prominent retired statesman…is persuaded to
                        say a few words at the unveiling of a plaque in All Souls or New College…by a curious
                        coincidence, both the 'informal discussions' in America and the unveiling speech at Oxford touch
                        on the same topical subject.</p>

                    <p>An analogous procedure in reverse could be used for policies or books which the Group did not
                        approve. A cutting editorial or an unfriendly book review, followed by a suffocating blanket of
                        silence and neglect, was the best that such an offering could expect from the instruments of the
                        Milner Group."</p>

                        international banking and financial capitalism. The key to all economics and prosperity was
                        considered to rest in banking and finance. With 'sound money,' a balanced budget, and the
                        international gold standard…[These ideas were] directly antithetical to the ideas of Milner as
                        revealed in his book published [in 1923]. Milner insisted that financial questions must be
                        subordinated to economic questions and economic questions to political questions… Milner wanted
                        to isolate the British economy from the world economy by tariffs and other barriers and
                        encourage the economic development of the United Kingdom by a system of government spending,

                        in 1868 and, as a kind of subsidiary of this, the Imperial Federation League in 1884. Many
                        Unionist members of the Cecil Bloc, such as Brassey and Goschen, were in these organizations. In
                        1875 F. P. Labilliere, a moving power in both organizations, read a paper before the older one
                        on 'The Permanent Unity of the Empire' and suggested a solution of the imperial problem by
                        creating a superimposed imperial legislative body and a central executive over the whole Empire,
                        including the United Kingdom. Seven years later, in 'The Political Organization of the Empire,'
                        he divided authority between this new federal authority and the Dominions by dividing the
                        business of government into imperial questions, local questions, and questions concerning both
                        levels."</p>

                    <p>"This article, entitled 'The Ethics of Empire,' is deserving of close attention. It emphasized
                        that the arguments for the Empire and the bonds which bind it together must be moral and not
                        based on considerations of material advantage or even of defense. This emphasis on moral
                        considerations, rather than economic or strategic, is typical of the Group as a whole and is
                        found in Milner and even in Rhodes. Professional politicians, bureaucrats, utilitarians, and
                        materialist social reformers are criticized for their failure to 'appeal convincingly as an
                        ideal of moral welfare to the ardour and imagination of a democratic people.' They are also
                        criticized for failure to see that this is the basis on which the Empire was reared...</p>

                    <p>[The Milner Group] members were motivated only slightly by materialistic incentives, and their
                        imperialism was motivated not at all by the desire to preserve or extend capitalism. On the
                        contrary their economic ideology, in the early stages at least, was more socialistic than
                        Manchester in its orientation. To be sure, it was an undemocratic kind of socialism, which was
                        willing to make many sacrifices to the wellbeing of the masses of the people but reluctant to
                        share with these masses political power that might allow them to seek their own well-being.</p>

                    <p>This socialistic leaning was more evident in the earlier (or Balliol) period than in the later
                        (or New College) period…Esher regarded the destruction of the middle class as inevitable and
                        felt that the future belonged to the workers and an administrative state…Even earlier, Arnold
                        Toynbee was a socialist of sorts and highly critical of the current ideology of liberal
                        capitalism as proclaimed by the high priests of the Manchester School.</p>

                    <p>Milner gave six lectures on socialism in Whitechapel in 1882... Both Toynbee and Milner worked
                        intermittently at social service of a mildly socialistic kind, an effort that resulted in the
                        founding of Toynbee Hall as a settlement house in 1884. As chairman of the board of Internal
                        Revenue in 1892-1897, Milner drew up Sir William Harcourt's budget, which inaugurated the
                        inheritance tax…Milner became increasingly radical, a development that did not fit any too well
                        with the conservative financial outlook of Brand, or even Hichens. As revealed in his book
                        <em>Questions of the Hour</em> (1923), Milner was a combination of technocrat and guild
                        socialist and objected vigorously to the orthodox financial policy of deflation, balanced
                        budget, gold standard, and free international exchange advocated by the Group after 1918."</p>

                    <p>"Duty to the state and loyalty to one's fellow citizens became the chief values of life…the
                        Milner Group saw the necessity of political organization in order to insure the continued
                        existence of freedom and higher ethical values and hoped to be able to preserve the values of
                        their day by organizing the whole world around the British Empire. Curtis puts this quite
                        clearly in <em>The Commonwealth of Nations</em> (1916), where he says: 'States, whether
                        autocracies or commonwealths, ultimately rest on duty, not on self interest or force.... The
                        quickening principle of a state is a sense of devotion, an adequate recognition somewhere in the
                        minds of its subjects that their own interests are subordinate to those of the state.'"
                        (Absolute nonsense; seduce people into accepting that and the only thing they'll be
                        "subordinate" to is the self-interest of the most talented liars, thieves and murderers.)</p>

                    <p>"In Asia and Africa, at least, England's civilizing mission was to be carried out by force, if
                        necessary, for 'the function of force is to give moral ideas time to take root.' Asia thus could
                        be compelled to accept civilization, a procedure justifiable to the Group on the grounds that
                        Asians are obviously better off under European rule than under the rule of fellow Asians and, if
                        consulted, would clearly prefer British rule to that of any other European power.</p>

                    <p>To be sure, the blessings to be extended to the less fortunate peoples of the world did not
                        include democracy. To Milner, to Curtis, and apparently to most members of the Group, democracy
                        was not an unmixed good, or even a good, and far inferior to rule by the best, or, as Curtis

                        to power in 1916 by a method which they repeated with the Labour Party in 1931. By a secret
                        intrigue with a parvenu leader of the government, the Group offered to make him head of a new
                        government if he would split his own party and become Prime Minister, supported by the Group and
                        whatever members he could split off from his own party. The chief difference between 1916 and
                        1931 is that in the former year the minority that was being betrayed was the Group's own social
                        class—in fact, the Liberal Party members of the Cecil Bloc. Another difference is that in 1916
                        the plot worked—the Liberal Party was split and permanently destroyed— while in 1931 the
                        plotters broke off only a fragment of the Labour Party and damaged it only temporarily (for
                        fourteen years). This last difference, however, was not caused by any lack of skill in carrying
                        out the intrigue but by the sociological differences between the Liberal Party and the Labour
                        Party in the twentieth century."</p>

                    <p>"Of Milner's role at this time, John Buchan wrote in his memoirs: 'In the Great War from 1916 to
                        1918, he was the executant of the War Cabinet who separated the sense from the nonsense in the
                        deliberations of that body, and was responsible for its chief practical achievements…' As Prime
                        Minister, Lloyd George had three members of the Group as his secretaries (P. H. Kerr, 1916-1922;
                        W. G. S. Adams, 1916-1919; E. W. M. Grigg, 1921-1922) and Waldorf Astor as his parliamentary
                        secretary (1917-1918). The chief decisions were made by the War Cabinet and Imperial War
                        Cabinet, whose membership merged and fluctuated but in 1917-1918 consisted of Lloyd George,
                        Milner, Curzon, and Smuts—that is, two members of the Milner Group, one of the Cecil Bloc, with
                        the Prime Minister himself."</p>

                        they felt that if Germany were made democratic and treated in a friendly fashion she could be

                    <p>"The evolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations is to a very great extent a
                        result of the activities of the Milner Group. To be sure, the ultimate goal of the Group was
                        quite different from the present system, since they wanted a federation of the Empire, but this
                        was a long-run goal, and en route they accepted the present system as a temporary way
                        station…The development of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations and the role
                        which the Milner Group played in this development cannot be understood by anyone who feels that
                        federation and commonwealth were mutually exclusive ideas.</p>

                    <p>In fact, there were not two ideas, but three, and they were not regarded by the Group as
                        substitutes for each other but as supplements to each other. These three ideas were: (1) the
                        creation of a common ideology and world outlook among the peoples of the United Kingdom, the
                        Empire, and the United States; (2) the creation of instruments and practices of cooperation
                        among these various communities in order that they might pursue parallel policies; and (3) the
                        creation of a federation on an imperial, Anglo-American, or world basis. The Milner Group
                        regarded these as supplementary to one another and worked vigorously for all of them, without
                        believing that they were mutually exclusive alternatives. They always realized, even the most
                        fanatical of them, that federation, even of the Empire only, was very remote. They always, in
                        this connection, used such expressions as 'not in our lifetime' or 'not in the present century.'
                        They always insisted that the basic unity of any system must rest on common ideology, and they
                        worked in this direction through the Rhodes Scholarships, the Round Table Groups, and the
                        Institutes of International Affairs…"</p>

                        illegally, to thwart it) while the Milner Group was 'for' home rule:</p>

                    <p>"The Cecil Bloc had always been opposed to Home Rule for Ireland, and when, in 1912-1914, the
                        Liberal government took steps to grant Home Rule, Sir Edward Carson took the lead in opposing
                        these steps….When the Home Rule Bill of 1914 was about to pass, Carson organized a private army,
                        known as the Ulster Volunteers, armed them with guns smuggled in from Germany, and formed a plot
                        to seize control of Belfast at a given signal from him. This signal, in the form of a code
                        telegram, was written in 1914 and on its way to be dispatched by Carson when he received word
                        from Asquith that war with Germany was inevitable. Accordingly, the revolt was canceled and the
                        date on which the Home Rule Bill was to go into effect was postponed by special act of
                        Parliament until six months after peace should be signed.</p>

                    <p>The information about the telegram of 1914 was revealed to Lionel Curtis by Carson in a personal
                        conversation after war began. Curtis's attitude was quite different, and he thoroughly
                        disapproved of Carson's plot. This difference is an indication of the difference in point of
                        view in regard to Ireland between the Milner Group and the Cecil Bloc. The latter was willing to
                        oppose Home Rule even to the point where it would condone illegal actions; the former, on the
                        contrary, was in favor of Home Rule because it believed that Ireland would aid Britain's enemies
                        in every crisis and leave the Commonwealth at the first opportunity unless it were given freedom
                        to govern itself."</p>

                        almost beyond belief. It was not a simple task, since they were simultaneously trying to do two
                        things: on the one hand, seeking to build up popular opinion in favor of the League so that its
                        work could be done more effectively; and, at the same time, seeking to prevent influential
                        people from using the League as an instrument of world government before popular opinion was
                        ready for a world government."</p>

                        fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia
                        against one another in Eastern Europe. In this way they felt that the two enemies would
                        stalemate one another, or that Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the
                        wheat of the Ukraine. It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and
                        Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. Even less did it occur to
                        them that Russia might beat Germany and thus open all Central Europe to Bolshevism."</p>

                        States:</p>

                    <p>"Hitler was given ample assurance by the Milner Group, both within and without the government,
                        that Britain would not oppose his efforts 'to achieve arms equality…' When France tried to
                        counterbalance Germany's rearmament by bringing the Soviet Union into her eastern alliance
                        system…the British counteracted this by making the Anglo-German naval agreement…This
                        agreement…allowed German to build up to 35 percent of the size of the British Navy (and up to
                        100 percent in submarines). This was a deadly stab in the back to France…This agreement put the
                        French Atlantic coast so completely at the mercy of the Germany Navy that France became
                        completely dependent on the British fleet for protection in this area.</p>

                    <p>It goes without saying that the whole inner core of the Group, and their chief publications, such
                        as <em>The Times</em> and <em>The Round Table</em>, approved the policy of appeasement
                        completely and prodded it along with calculated indiscretions when it was felt necessary to do
                        so. After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, <em>The Times</em> cynically called this act 'a

                        repudiated it. From that moment the keystone was taken out of the whole arch of any League of

                        agreement of France, Germany, Italy, and herself; and (c) that Britain was prepared to allow
                        Germany to liquidate Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland if this could be done without provoking
                        a war into which the British Government, however unwillingly, would be dragged in opposition to

                        propaganda, he said, must be the churches and the universities. He said nothing about the Milner
                        Group, but, considering Curtis's position in this Group and that Lothian and others agreed with
                        him, it is not surprising that the chief source of this propaganda is to be found in those

                        hand over Czechoslovakia to Hitler. This was done in the war-scare of September 15-28 in London.
                        That this war-scare was fraudulent and that Lord Halifax was deeply involved in its creation is
                        now clear…To frighten the British people, the British government circulated stories about the
                        strength of the German Army and Air Force which were greatly exaggerated; they implied that
                        Germany would use poison gas at once and from the air, although this was quite untrue; they
                        distributed gas masks and madly built trenches in London parks, although the former were
                        needless and the latter worthless…The fraudulent nature of the Munich crisis appears throughout

                        for the Munich surrender, they have continued to repeat the untrue propaganda stories of 1937
                        -1939 regarding German armaments…They have done this even though this story is untrue and they

                    <p>"All of this evidence and much more would seem to support the theory of a 'Munich plot'—that is,
                        the theory that the British government had no intention or desire to save Czechoslovakia in 1938
                        and was willing or even eager to see it partitioned by Hitler, and only staged the war scare of
                        September in order to make the British people accept this abuse of honor and sacrifice of
                        Britain's international position. The efforts which the British government made after Munich to
                        conceal the facts of that affair would support this interpretation. The chief question, from our
                        point of view, lies in the degree to which the Milner Group were involved in this 'plot.' There
                        can be no doubt that the Chamberlain group was the chief factor in the scheme. There is also no
                        doubt that various members of the Milner Group second circle, who were close to the Chamberlain
                        group, were involved. The position of the inner core of the Milner Group is not conclusively
                        established, but there is no evidence that they were not involved and a certain amount of
                        evidence that they were involved."</p>
