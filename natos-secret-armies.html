                <p><span class="page-ref">XI:</span> The Gladio "stay-behind network" created by the CIA and MI6:</p>

                <p>"The executive agents in the creation of the stay-behind networks were the Central Intelligence
                    Agency (CIA) of the United States and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) of the United
                    Kingdom. Other major actors included security services in a number of European countries."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">XII:</span> The NATO secret armies remained hidden until the Italian
                    government revealed the existence of its own secret army in 1990</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">XIV:</span> The author, Daniele Ganser, begins four years of study into
                    Operation Gladio + 1959 Document proves CIA / NATO link:</p>

                <p>"When looking for a PhD research topic in early 1998, I became interested in the Gladio phenomenon,
                    of which I had not previously heard. After some research I realized that despite its great
                    importance for the most recent political, social and military history of Western Europe and the
                    United States, only very limited work had been carried out on the phenomenon of the secret NATO
                    armies, with no single study on the topic available in English…many well-meaning friends advised me
                    against taking it as a PhD topic. Very sensibly they argued that I would gain access neither to the
                    archives of the secret services, nor to primary data on the topic from NATO and its Office of
                    Security. Furthermore they predicted that the number of countries, which by the end of my research
                    had unexpectedly risen to fourteen, as well as the time frame I intended to investigate in each of
                    these countries, five decades, not only would wear me out, but would also necessarily leave my
                    findings fragmented and incomplete. That in addition to these problems I would have to work with
                    texts in more than ten different European languages, of which I personally could only read five,
                    made matters crystal clear: Gladio was not a suitable PhD research topic.</p>

                <p>…I nevertheless embarked upon the research project and dedicated the next four years of my life to
                    the investigation. At the time my determination to proceed, and my ability to convince my advising
                    professors, was based on one single original document from the Italian military secret service
                    SIFAR, dated June 1, 1959 and entitled 'the special forces of SIFAR and Operation Gladio.' This
                    document proved that a CIA- and NATO-linked secret army code-named Gladio had existed in Italy
                    during the Cold War…"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">XV:</span> "The so-called stay-behind armies had existed in all 16 NATO
                    countries during the Cold War" and also in four neutral countries + CIA, NATO and other government
                    agencies won't release documents:</p>

                <p>"Next to the challenges that rise with respect to the number of countries, gathering data for each
                    single country too proved difficult. It was most distressing that governments, NATO and secret
                    services withheld requested documents despite a FOIA request to the CIA, numerous letters to NATO,
                    and official requests to European governments…the analysis had therefore to be based on numerous
                    secondary sources, including parliamentary reports, testimonies of persons involved as reported by
                    the international press, articles, books and documentaries, needless to say, such secondary sources
                    can never be a substitute for the original primary documents, and all future research must clearly
                    aim for access to primary documents. If, however, the data presented hereafter first of all enables
                    researchers to gain an overview of a phenomenon which otherwise might have remained inaccessible,
                    and in the second place enabled processes which in the future will lead to access to primary
                    documents, then the main purposes of this book will have been achieved."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">1-2:</span> Good introduction info and summary:</p>

                <p>"As the details of the operation emerged, the press concluded that the 'story seems straight from the
                    pages of a political thriller.' The secret armies were equipped by the CIA and the MI6 with machine
                    guns, explosives, munitions and high-tech communication equipment hidden in arms caches in forests,
                    meadows and underground bunkers across Western Europe. Leading officers of the secret network
                    trained together with the US Green Berets Special Forces in the United States of America and the
                    British SAS Special Forces in England."</p>

                <p>[The pretext for setting up the armies was to counter the consequences of a Soviet invasion of
                    Western Europe] "Yet the Soviet invasion never came. The real and present danger in the eyes of the
                    secret war strategists in Washington and London were the at-times numerically strong Communist
                    parties in the democracies of Western Europe. Hence the network in the total absence of a Soviet
                    invasion took up arms in numerous countries and fought a secret war against the political forces of
                    the left. The secret armies, as the secondary sources now available suggest, were involved in a
                    whole series of terrorist operations and human rights violations that they wrongly blamed on the
                    Communists in order to discredit the left at the polls. The operations always aimed at spreading
                    maximum fear among the population and ranged from bomb massacres in trains and market squares
                    (Italy), the use of systematic torture of the opponents of the regime (Turkey), the support for
                    right-wing coup d'états (Greece and Turkey), to the smashing of opposition groups (Portugal and
                    Spain)."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">3:</span> Peteano Car Bomb in 1972, false report designed to discredit
                    communists:</p>

                <p>"For more than a decade the Italian population believed that the Red Brigades had committed the
                    Peteano terrorist attack. Then, in 1984, young Italian Judge Felice Casson reopened the long dormant
                    case after having discovered with surprise an entire series of blunders and fabrications surrounding
                    the Peteano atrocity. Judge Casson found that there had been no police investigation on the scene.
                    He also discovered that the report which at the time claimed the explosive used in Peteano had been
                    the one traditionally used by the Red Brigades was a forgery…Judge Casson was able to prove that the
                    explosive used in Peteano…was C4, the most powerful explosive available at the time, used also by
                    NATO. 'I wanted that new light should be shed on these years of lies and mysteries, that's all,'
                    Casson years later told journalists…"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">4:</span> Judge Casson conducts investigation, it revealed "right wing
                    organization" and "Italian Secret Service" were responsible for bombing. Vincenzo Vinciguerra
                    confessed and testified:</p>

                <p>"Casson's investigation revealed that…Ordine Nuovo [New Order] had collaborated very closely with the
                    Italian Military Secret Service…Together they had engineered the Peteano terror and then wrongly
                    blamed…the Red Brigades. Judge Casson identified Ordine Nuovo member Vincenzo Vinciguerra as the man
                    who had planted the Peteano bomb... He confessed and testified that he had been covered by an entire
                    network of sympathizers in Italy and abroad who had ensured that after the attack he could escape.
                    'A whole mechanism came into action', Vinciguerra recalled" (the Italian military police), "'the
                    Minister of the Interior, the customs services and the military and civilian intelligence services
                    accepted the ideological reasoning behind the attack.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">5:</span> Gladio operatives killed indiscriminately to discredit the Red
                    Brigades + Piazza Fontana bombing and others including Bologna:</p>

                <p>"According to an evil strategy the terror was wrongly blamed on the Communists and the extreme left,
                    traces were covered up and arrests followed immediately. The population at large had little chances
                    to find out the truth, as the military secret service went to great lengths to cover up the
                    crime…The atrocities culminated on a sunny afternoon during the Italian national holiday when on
                    August 2, 1980 a massive explosion ripped through the waiting room of the second class at the
                    Bologna railway station, killing 85 people in the blast and seriously injuring and maiming a further
                    200…Contrary to the Red Brigades who ended up in jail, the terrorists of the right mysteriously
                    escaped after each massacre because, as Vinciguerra correctly pointed out, the security apparatus of
                    the Italian state and the military secret services protected them."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">6:</span> General Giandelio Meletti, former head of Italian
                    counterintelligence, implicates the CIA under oath:</p>

                <p>"General Giandelio Meletti…suggested that next to the Gladio secret army, the Italian secret service
                    and a group of Italian right-wing terrorists, the massacres which had discredited the Italian
                    communists had also been supported by the White House in Washington and the US secret service
                    CIA…Maletti testified: 'The CIA, following the directives of its government, wanted to create an
                    Italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left, and, for this purpose, it
                    may have made use of right-wing terrorism…The impression was that the American would do anything to
                    stop Italy from sliding to the left.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">7:</span> Vinciguerra's admits: "had to attack civilians:"</p>

                <p>"Vinciguerra…related: 'You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people,
                    unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple…to force these
                    people…to turn to the State to ask for greater security. This is the political logic that lies
                    behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished, because the State cannot convict
                    itself or declare itself responsible for what happened…With the massacre of Peteano, and with all
                    those that have followed,' Vinciguerra explained on trial in 1984, 'the knowledge should by now be
                    clear that there existed a real live structure, occult and hidden, with the capacity of giving a
                    strategic direction to the outrages...[it] lies within the state itself...There exists in Italy a
                    secret force parallel to the armed forces, composed of civilians and military men, in an anti-Soviet
                    capacity...A secret organization, a super-organization with a network of communications, arms and
                    explosives, and men trained to use them...A super-organization which…took up the task, on NATO's
                    behalf, of preventing a slip to the left in the political balance of the country. This they did,
                    with the assistance of the official secret services and the political and military forces.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">9:</span> Finally, Italian government is forced to admit Gladio's existence:
                </p>

                    and for the first time in Italy's post-war history confirmed as acting member of the Italian

                <p><span class="page-ref">14:</span> Gladio kept secret for 45 years</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">19:</span> In Spain, Gladio "was the government"</p>

                <p>"In neighboring Spain, which similar to Portugal during most of the Cold War had been a right-wing
                    dictatorship which fought the political opposition with terror and torture, Alberto Oliart, Defense
                    Minister in the early 1980's, considered it to be 'childish' to ask whether…a secret right-wing army
                    had existed in the country because 'here Gladio was the government.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">20:</span> Gladio in Turkey "involved in torture, massacres and assassination

                <p>"In Turkey the ruling elite took a stand on the Gladio issue on December 3 when [Turkish generals]
                    confirmed to the press the existence of a secret NATO army in Turkey directed by the 'Special
                    Warfare Department…' While the Generals stressed that the members of the Turkish Gladio were all
                    good 'patriots' the press and former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit stressed that the secret army
                    (called Counter-Guerrilla) had been repeatedly involved in torture, massacres and assassination
                    operations as well as the coup d'états the country had suffered from…Thereafter the ruling military
                    refused to answer questions from parliament and civil Ministers, and Turkish Defense Minister Giray
                    warned that 'Ecevit had better keep his fucking mouth shut!'"</p>

                <p>"Dutch MP Vandemeulebroucke captured the feeling of many Europeans well when he summarized that 'This
                    affair leaves a bad taste in the mouth, since it has been going on for as long as the European
                    Community has been in existence, and we claim to be creating a new form of democracy…it now emerges
                    that there are centres for taking decisions and carrying them out which are not subject to any form
                    of democratic control…I should like to protect most strongly against the fact that the American

                    linked to massacres, torture, coup d'états and other terrorist operations in several countries of
                    Western Europe…After almost a month of silence on Monday November 5 1990, NATO categorically denied
                    Andreotti's allegation concerning NATO's involvement in operation Gladio and the secret armies.
                    Senior NATO spokesman Jean Marcotta said at SHAPE headquarters… 'NATO has never contemplated
                    guerrilla war or clandestine operations; it has always concerned itself with military affairs and
                    the defense of the Allied frontiers.' Then, on Tuesday November 6, a NATO spokesman explained that
                    NATO's denial of the previous day had been false. The spokesman left journalists only with a short
                    communique which said that NATO never commented on matters of military secrecy and that Marcotta

                    is characterized by silence and denials. When the author during his research in summer 2000

                    CPC the military alliance replied: 'We have checked our Archives and cannot find any trace of the

                    Cold War was to combat Communism globally in covert action operations and promote the influence of
                    the United States. 'By covert action operations,' US President Richard Nixon once defined the
                    tactic, 'I mean those activities which, although designed to further official US programs and
                    policies abroad, are so planned and executed that the hand of the US government is not apparent to
                    unauthorized persons.' …From a systematic scientific perspective the covert action department of the
                    CIA according to the definition of the FBI is…a terrorist organisation. Because 'Terrorism,'
                    according to the FBI, 'is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to

                    the author's request 'pertaining to Operation Gladio' in an evasive manner by stating that 'The CIA

                    secret today.' …In February 2001 the CIA replied that 'Your appeal has been accepted and

                <p>"Operations in Italy weakened the Communists and were a success. President Truman became fascinated
                    with covert action as an instrument of statecraft and urged that the power of the CIA in the field
                    had to be extended beyond Italy. Therefore on June 18, 1948 the NSC passed the notorious directive
                    NSC 10/2 which authorised the CIA to carry out covert action operations in all countries of the
                    world and within the CIA created a covert action branch under the name of 'Office of Special
                    Projects,' a label soon changed to the less revealing 'Office of Policy Coordination' (OPC). NSC
                    10/2 directed that OPC shall 'plan and conduct covert operations.' By 'covert operations' NSC 10/2
                    designated all activities '<strong>which are conducted or sponsored by this government</strong>
                    against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups
                    <strong>but which are so planned and conducted that any US Government responsibility for them is not
                        evident to unauthorised persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim
                        any responsibility for them</strong>.' Specifically covert action operations according to NSC
                    10/2 'shall include any covert activities related to propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct
                    action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against
                    hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee

                    Italian Communists, due to their performance at the polls, also demanded to be rewarded with posts
                    in the cabinet and in May 1963 the large union of the construction workers demonstrated in Rome. The
                    CIA was alarmed and members of the secret Gladio army disguised as police and civilians smashed the
                    demonstration leaving more than 200 demonstrators injured. But for Italy the worst was yet to come.
                    In November 1963, US President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas…And five months later the
                    cIA with the SIFAR, the Gladio secret army and the paramilitary police carried out a right-wing coup

                    Renzo Rocca, Director of the Gladio units within the military secret service SID, De Lorenzo
                    escalated the secret war. Rocca first used his secret Gladio army to bomb the offices of the DCI and
                    the offices of a few daily newspapers and thereafter blamed the terror on the left in order to
                    discredit both Communists and Socialists…on June 14, 1964, De Lorenzo gave the go-ahead and with his
                    troops entered Rome with tanks, armoured personnel carriers, jeeps and grenade launchers while NATO
                    forces staged a large military manoeuvre in the area to intimidate the Italian government…After the
                    coup the Gladio traces were covered up. Several years later, in July 1968, investigators wanted to
                    question Gladio commander Renzo Rocca. The Gladiator was willing to cooperate but the day before his
                    testimony was found dead, shot with a pistol through his head, in his private apartment in Rome. A

                <p>Upon his return to Italy, Moro was sick for days and contemplated his complete withdrawal from
                    politics. 'It's one of the few occasions when my husband told me exactly what had been said to him,
                    without telling me the name of the person concerned,' Moro's wife Eleonora later testified. 'I will
                    try and repeat it now: <em>You must abandon your policy of bringing all the political forces in your
                        country into direct collaboration. Either you give this up or you will pay dearly for it.</em>'
                    In the national elections of June 1976, the PCI secured its best ever result at the polls…and
                    clearly defeated the DCI. Consequently, acting president of the DCI Aldo Moro found the courage to
                    defeat the USA's veto. On March 16, 1978 he packed the documents of the 'historical compromise' into
                    his suitcase and ordered his driver as well as his bodyguards to bring him to the palace of the
                    Italian parliament in Rome where he was determined to present the plan to include the Italian
                    Communists in the executive. Moro's car was approaching a crossroads…when a white Fiat suddenly
                    reversed around the corner and blocked the path…Two men from the white car and a further four who
                    had been waiting in the street opened fire on Moro's five bodyguards. Moro after his return from
                    Washington had become uneasy and had asked for a bulletproof car, yet the request had been turned
                    down. And thus the shots went through the care and his bodyguards were killed right away….Moro
                    himself was captured and held hostage in central Rome for 55 days. Thereafter Moro's bullet ridden
                    body was found in the [trunk] of an abandoned car in central Rome symbolically parked halfway
                    between the headquarters of the DCI and the headquarters of the PCI.</p>

                <p>Italy was in shock. The military secret service and acting Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti
                    immediately blamed the left-wing terrorist organisation Red Brigades for the crime and cracked down
                    on the left. 72,000 roadblocks were erected and 37,000 houses were searched.</p>

                <p>The Senate commission investigating Gladio and the massacres suspected the CIA and the Italian
                    military secret service including its Gladio hit squads to have organised the Moro crime. It
                    therefore reopened the case but found with much surprise that almost all files on the Moro
                    kidnapping and murder had mysteriously disappeared from the archives of the Ministry of the
                    Interior."</p>

                    Otto Skorzeny, a former Nazi…Skorzeny was employed by Franco's secret service as a 'security

                    Portuguese stay-behind army, "Aginter Press."</p>

                <p>"Despite Salazar's support for the coup in Spain and his alliance with Hitler and Mussolini, to the
                    surprise of many, Portugal in 1949 was able to figure among the founding members of NATO…The
                    existence of secret CIA and NATO-linked armies in Portugal was revealed for the first time in 1990
                    following the exposure of the Italian Gladio stay-behind. 'In Portugal a Lisbon radio station has
                    reported that cells of the network associated with Operation Gladio were active during the 1950's to
                    defend the rightist dictatorship of Dr. Salazar,' the international press revealed. And five years
                    later US author Michael Parenti, without giving any further sources, claimed that Gladio operatives
                    'helped prop up a fascist regime in Portugal.'</p>

                <p>More specifically the local press claimed in 1990 that the secret army in Portugal was allegedly
                    called 'Aginter Press.' Under the headline 'Gladio was active in Portugal,' the Portuguese daily
                    <em>O Jornal</em> informed a stunned audience in the country that 'The secret network, erected at
                    the bosom of NATO and financed by the CIA…had a branch in Portugal in the 1960's and the 1970's. It
                    was called <em>Aginter Press</em>' and was allegedly involved in assassination operations in
                    Portugal as well as in the Portuguese colonies in Africa.
                </p>

                <p>Aginter Press was no press at all. The organisation did not print books or anti-Communist propaganda
                    leaflets but trained right-wing terrorists and specialised in dirty tricks and secret warfare in
                    Portugal and beyond. The mysterious and brutal organisation was supported by the CIA and run by
                    European right-wing officers who with the help of the PIDE recruited fascist militants. The
                    investigation of the Italian Senate into Gladio and the secret war and massacres in Italy discovered
                    that Italian right-wing extremists had also been trained by Aginter Press. '…Aginter Press,' the
                    Italian Gladio report concluded, 'in reality, according to the latest documents acquired by the
                    criminal investigation, was an information centre directly linked to the CIA and the Portuguese
                    secret service, that specialized in provocation operations.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">117:</span> Delle Chiaie + Guerin Serac and Aginter Press</p>

                <p>"In Portugal Guerin Serac…erected Aginter Press as an ultra-secret anti-Communist army with the
                    support of both the PIDE and the CIA. Aginter Press set up training camps in which it instructed
                    mercenaries and terrorists in a three-week course in covert action techniques including hands-on
                    bomb terrorism, silent assassination, subversion techniques, clandestine communication and
                    infiltration and colonial warfare.</p>

                <p>Next to Guerin Serac, Italian right-wing terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie was among the founding
                    fathers of Aginter Press. 'We acted against the Communists and against the bourgeois state, against
                    the democracy, which deprived us from our liberty. And thus we had to use violence,' Delle Chiaie
                    later reasoned. 'We were considered to be criminals, but in reality we were but the victims of an
                    anti-Fascist liberal movement.' …Aged 30, Delle Chiaie in the mid-1960s together with Guerin Serac
                    and the support of the CIA set up the Aginter secret army. 'Together with a French friend of mine
                    [Guerin Serac] I decided back then [1965] to establish the press agency Aginter Press, in order to
                    be able to defend our political views.' In the Years that followed Delle Chiaie became maybe the
                    most brutal right-wing terrorist directly linked to the secret war. In Italy he engaged in coup
                    detats and massacres, including the Piazza Fontana massacre of 1969, and in Latin America together
                    with Nazi Klaus Barbie, the 'butcher of Lyon,' he propped up right-wing dictatorships.</p>

                <p>Guerin Serac himself, together with many others, was convinced that in order to defeat Communism in
                    Western Europe secret terrorist operations were necessary: 'In the first phase of our political
                    activity we must create chaos in all structures of the regime' he declared without specifically
                    indicating the state targeted. 'Two forms of terrorism can provocate such a situation: the blind
                    terrorism (committing massacres indiscriminately which cause a large number of victims), and the
                    selective terrorism (eliminate chosen persons).' In each case the terror carried out secretly by the
                    extreme right had to be blamed on the left, as the master and eminence grise of anti-Communist
                    terrorism insisted: 'This destruction of the state must be carried out as much as possible under the
                    cover of <em>Communist activities</em>.' The terrorist attacks of the secret armies are designed as
                    a means to discredit the ruling government and force it to shift to the right: 'After that, we must
                    intervene…in order to influence popular opinion, suggest a solution, and clearly demonstrate the
                    weakness of the present legal apparatus…Popular opinion must be polarised in such a way, that we are
                    being presented as the only instrument capable of saving the nation.'</p>

                <p>The CIA and Salazar's military secret service PIDE provided the finances for the terrorism…An Aginter
                    document, entitled 'Our Political Activity'…describes how a country can be targeted with secret
                    warfare: 'Our belief is that the first phase of political activity ought to be to create the
                    conditions favouring the installation of chaos in all of the regime's structures.' As the most
                    essential component of the strategy the violence inflicted had to be blamed on the Communists and
                    traces had to be planted accordingly. 'In our view the first move we should make is to destroy the
                    structure of the democratic state under the cover of Communist and pro-Chinese activities.' The
                    document continued to stress that left-wing militant groups had to be infiltrated and manipulated:
                    'Moreover, we have people who have infiltrated these groups and obviously we will have to tailor our
                    actions to the ethos of the milieu – propaganda and action of a sort which will seem to have
                    emanated from our Communist adversaries.'</p>

                <p>Such false flag operations, the secret soldiers concluded, 'will create a feeling of hostility
                    towards those who threaten the peace of each and every nation,' i.e. the Communists."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">122:</span> More false flags:</p>

                <p>"After the fall of the Portuguese dictatorship Guerin Serac and his militant anti-Communists had fled
                    to neighbouring Spain and protected by Franco re-established headquarters in Madrid. True to their
                    trade, Aginter secret soldiers in exchange for asylum agreed with Franco's secret service to hunt
                    down and assassinate leading members of the Bask separatist movement ETA. Furthermore they continued
                    their clandestine operations abroad and amongst others attempted to discredit the Algerian
                    liberation movement. 'I can provide you with another very interesting example,' Italian judge
                    Salvini related to the Italian Senators, whereupon he explained that from their Spanish base in 1975
                    the group of Guerin Serac, together with the American Salby and militant French, Italian and Spanish
                    rightists, had organised a series of bomb attacks each time leaving the signal SOA, which signifies
                    'Algerian Opposition' in order to discredit a group of the Algerian opposition.</p>

                <p>'The bombs were planted at Algerian embassies in four different countries, France, Germany, Italy and
                    Great Britain' and made the Algerian opposition look bad, while 'in reality the bombings were
                    carried out by the group of Guerin Serac, who thus demonstrated his great camouflage and
                    infiltration capabilities.' The bomb in front of the Algerian embassy in Frankfurt did not blow up
                    and was meticulously analysed by the German police. 'In order to understand the links of Guerin
                    Serac and Aginter Press, it is important to notice the complex fabrication of the bomb,' judge
                    Salvini highlighted. 'It contained C4, an explosive exclusively used by the US forces, which has
                    never been used in any of the anarchist bombings. I repeat, this was a very sophisticated bomb. That
                    Aginter had C4 at its [disposal] certainly shows which contacts it enjoyed.'"</p>

                    London. Above Belgium they parachuted into a designated rea and were met by a local Belgian agent

                    the operation…When in 1990 the entire stay-behind network was exposed, Belgian secret soldier

                    and their arms arsenals controlled by Germany's democratic institutions?</p>

                <p>One day after the massacre the German criminal police investigating the crime had received
                    information that Lembke had supplied the right-wing extremists. 'Mister Lembke showed us different

                <p>Lembke insisted that he was willing to speak only to the public prosecutor who without success had
                    interrogated him in the Roeder case. The request was granted and the prosecutor immediately
                    travelled to Lembke's prison cell. There Lembke finally talked, revealing in detail all the 33 arms
                    caches of which until then only some had been found. That evening Lembke said to his interrogator
                    that he might reveal to him the next day who was supposed to use the guns and explosives. The next
                    day, November 1, 1981, Lembke was found hanging on a rope from the ceiling of his prison cell."</p>

                    Special Warfare Department. His surprise increased when the clandestine department asked him for
                    funds which allegedly were needed for a new headquarters. When Ecevit inquired how long the

                    operations, torture, murder, rape, etc. …he was assassinated:</p>

                <p>"Until today the involvement of NATO's stay-behind in the massacres against the Kurds ranges among
                    the greatest secrets in Turkey and Washington. Major Cem Ersever, a former commander of Turkish
                    paramilitary units that had operated against the PKK, later quite openly described in his book how
                    the Counter-Guerrilla and other paramilitary units employed secret warfare and terror against the
                    PKK. Ersever also revealed how his terror units became rich by raising private taxes along the
                    'Heroin Highway' as the drugs coming from Afghanistan on their way to the west had to pass through
                    Turkey.</p>

                <p>Among the operations of the Counter-Guerrilla which Ersever revealed were the false flag operations
                    in which the Counter-Guerrilla, dressed up as PKK fighters, attacked villages, raped and executed
                    people randomly. This, if the disguise was effective, weakened the support for the PKK in the area
                    and turned the people against the PKK. Ersever confirmed that many former Grey Wolves and other
                    right-wing extremists had been recruited directly from prisons into the stay-behind death squads,
                    which also included captured PKK deserters and Islamists. Ersever had described the situation
                    correctly and after the publication of his book in November 1993 was executed following the
                    classical Counter-Guerrilla method: Tortured and shot through the head Ersevers's body was found
                    with his hands bound behind his back."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">242:</span> Investigation blocked in Turkey:</p>

                <p>"While the international press pondered on the question of how directly NATO an the US Pentagon had
                    sponsored the massacres in Turkey, the ruling military in Turkey in 1990 blocked all further
                    investigations. There was no parliamentary commission to investigate either the Counter-Guerrilla
                    stay-behind or the Special Warfare Department. The ruling military also refused to answer questions
                    from both parliament and Ministers and Turkish Defense Minister Giray, deposed a month before the
                    Gladio scandal, insisted that 'Ecevit had better keep his fucking mouth shut!'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">242-243:</span> "A policeman, a parliamentarian, a druglord" and a former
                    Turkish beauty queen "turned Mafia hit-women" are involved in a fatal car accident, sparks outrage
                    in Turkey:</p>

                <p>[This was] "a somewhat unusual combination of passengers as the press immediately noticed and former
                    Prime Minister Ecevit rightly commented to parliament that 'The accident unveiled the dark liaisons
                    within the state.'</p>

                <p>Following the accident Turkey witnessed maybe its strongest movement against the Counter-Guerrilla
                    and corrupt governmental officials when every night at 9 p.m. angry crowds called for 'cleansing the
                    country from the gangs.' …Nearly 100,000 workers marched in protest in the Turkish capital demanding
                    the truth about the stay-behind soldiers while people on the streets in opinion polls expressed
                    their belief that the Turkish judicial system was not working properly and that the government was
                    corrupt, declaring that they were sick and tired of all the violence and secret operations. Millions
                    followed the country-wide protest action 'One minute of darkness for complete Clarification' and in
                    protest switched off all lights each evening at 9 p.m. for over a month and thus darkened whole
                    cities.</p>

                <p>Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in front of the press confirmed the obvious when he declared that
                    'claims are of a highly serious nature' according to which there exists within the Turkish state 'a
                    special operations section at the General Directorate of Security. Some staff members of that
                    section have been engaged in narcotics trading, gambling schemes, extortion and murder…These are
                    murderers working under orders from the state.' While Prime Minister Erbakan stressed: 'You cannot
                    have a gang within the state. Nobody can be allowed to do anything illegal, with no exceptions.
                    Nothing, including fighting the PKK, can be an excuse for crime. If such things happen, those gangs,
                    whatever their makeup, must be disbanded.'</p>

                <p>The press sharply attacked the secret service and declared that the 'MIT does not just engage in
                    repression and terror against the people. It is involved in every kind of dirty business, such as
                    the drugs trade, extortion and prostitution…the MIT bears responsibility for the disappeared, for
                    massacres and torture.' …Together with the MIT also the CIA came into the line of fire when the
                    press highlighted the intimate relationship between the two secret services."</p>
