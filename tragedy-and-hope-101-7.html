                    <p>Around the time it became clear the United States wouldn't join the League of Nations, the
                        Network began the process of undermining the organization. Quigley seems perplexed by this,
                        especially regarding its erosion of provisions within the League that, although harsh, were
                        meant to restrain dangerous groups that still held power in post-WWI Germany. On page 232 of
                        <em>The Anglo-American Establishment</em>, he writes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Philip Kerr was…at the very center of the Milner Group. His violent Germanophobia…and his
                            evident familiarity with the character of the Germans…<em>should have</em> made the Treaty
                            of Versailles very acceptable to him and his companions, or, if not, unacceptable on grounds
                            of excessive <em>leniency</em>. Instead, Kerr…and the whole inner core of the Milner Group
                            began a campaign to undermine the treaty, the League of Nations, and the whole peace
                            settlement…The Milner Group…began their program of appeasement and revision of the
                            settlement as early as 1919. Why did they do this?</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Quigley answers his own question via a process that he admits involves "a certain amount of
                        conjecture." First, he argues that the well-meaning men of the Network had simply mistaken the
                        true nature (and actual identity) of those who continued to rule Germany after its defeat in
                        1918. <em>If only they had known</em> these facts, they wouldn't have pursued the flawed policy
                        of appeasement, and "there need never have been a Second World War." In Quigley's defense, he
                        does mention that:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The Milner Group did not see…because they did not want to see.</p>

                        <p>The Milner Group knew that [the true powers in Germany] were cooperating with the
                            reactionaries to suppress all democratic and enlightened elements in Germany and to help the
                            forces of despotism.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Quigley then goes on to describe a series of deceptive actions taken by the Group (where they
                        <em>pretended</em> to support positions that they actually opposed, and <em>pretended</em> to
                        oppose positions that they actually supported), and the reader is left wondering how anyone
                        could possibly decipher what the Group was <em>truly</em> thinking or trying to accomplish. For
                        instance, he states that the "economic expert" within the Milner Group decided that the best way
                        to <em>help Germany</em> become an upstanding member of Western civilization would be to have
                        the United States begin loaning Germany money.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"
                            class="footnote">[3]</a> But if the Group <em>knew</em> the "forces of despotism" were being
                        empowered, and assuming they did not want to strengthen those forces, why would they begin
                        extending "concessions to the Germans without any attempt to purge Germany of its vicious
                        elements and without any guarantee that those concessions would not be used against everything
                        the Group held dear"?<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>

                    <p>One could reasonably argue that the loans offered to help Germany were simply part of a
                        surreptitious financial warfare strategy. On pages 308 and 309 of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>,
                        Quigley describes an $800 million loan to Germany, known as the Dawes Plan, this way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The Dawes Plan, which was largely a J. P. Morgan production, was drawn up by an international
                            committee of financial experts…Germany paid reparations for five years under the Dawes Plan
                            (1924–1929) and owed more at the end than it had owed at the beginning…It is worthy of note
                            that this system was set up by the international bankers and that the subsequent lending of
                            other people's money to Germany was profitable to these bankers…With these American loans,
                            Germany was able to rebuild her industrial system to make it the second best in the world by
                            a wide margin…The only things wrong with the system were (a) that it would collapse as soon
                            as the United States ceased to lend, and (b) in the meantime debts were merely being shifted
                            from one account to another and no one was really getting any nearer to solvency…Nothing was
                            settled by all this, but the international bankers sat in heaven, under a rain of fees and
                            commissions.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill debt trap; the bankers get rich as a targeted nation
                        gets buried in inescapable debt. However, this particular nation was using the borrowed money to
                        rebuild its capacity for war. Backed with an industrial system that ranked second in the world
                        "by a wide margin," the idea that Germany's "vicious elements" would simply accept having their
                        funding cut (once they were militarily strong enough to <em>seize</em> new resources) is pretty
                        farfetched. The Network was wise enough to know that its actions were creating a potentially
                        dangerous military force in Europe, one that couldn't be easily contained via economic sanctions
                        alone. So, does this mean that it wanted Germany, vicious elements and all, to become strong
                        again? In a word, yes. Quigley eventually settles on this conclusion and then offers an
                        explanation for why the Network decided to undermine the League of Nations.</p>

                    <p>After the United States refused to join the League, members of the Milner Group concluded that
                        their best option in Europe was to revive Germany and use it as a weapon against both France and
                        Russia. But before this balance-of-power strategy could be implemented, the League of Nations
                        would have to be destroyed. (As it was written, the League would not only interfere with
                        Germany's ability to rearm, but it would also interfere with Germany's ability to violate the
                        sovereignty of neighboring nations.)</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The aim of the Milner Group through the period from 1920 to 1938 was the same: to maintain
                            the balance of power in Europe by building up Germany against France and Russia; to increase
                            Britain's weight in that balance…to refuse any commitments (especially any commitments
                            through the League of Nations, and above all any commitments to aid France)…to drive Germany
                            eastward against Russia if either or both of these two powers became a threat to the peace
                            of Western Europe.</p>

                        <p>From 1921 onward, the Milner Group and the British Government…did all they could to lighten
                            the reparations burden on Germany and to prevent France from using force to collect
                            reparations.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Remember, France had only survived German aggression during WWI because Britain, the United
                        States, Russia, and Italy had come to her aid. As the Network's secret policy to remilitarize
                        Germany began taking shape, the French became progressively more alarmed. Quigley writes that
                        France "sought in vain one alternative after another" to guarantee its security and to keep
                        Germany down, but "all of these efforts were blocked by the machinations of the Milner Group."<a
                            href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a> When, at the behest of the Network, Britain
                        blocked the Geneva Protocol in 1924, this finally sparked outrage around the world. True to
                        form, the Network simply turned the outrage to its own advantage.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>There was an outburst of public sentiment against the selfish and cold-blooded action…As a
                            result of this feeling, which was widespread throughout the world, the Group determined to
                            give the world the <em>appearance</em> of a guarantee to France. This was done in the
                            Locarno Pacts…In reality, the agreements gave France nothing while they gave Britain a veto
                            over French fulfillment of her alliances…if Germany moved east against Czechoslovakia [or]
                            Poland…and if France attacked Germany's western frontier in support of Czechoslovakia or
                            Poland, as her alliances bound her to do, Great Britain, Belgium and Italy might be bound by
                            the Locarno Pacts to come to the aid of Germany.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7"
                                class="footnote">[7]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This, of course, wasn't the last time the Network betrayed world opinion and public trust in
                        pursuit of its disastrous European agenda. Quigley uses the term "dual policy" to describe
                        additional deceptions that were employed in the run-up to World War II. ("Dual policy" can be
                        summarized as <em>pretending</em> to honor the "will of the people" publicly, while continuing
                        to pursue antithetical policies behind the scenes.) These deliberate deceptions not only
                        empowered men like Adolf Hitler in Germany, they also empowered the fascist regimes of Benito
                        Mussolini in Italy and Francisco Franco in Spain.</p>

                    <h2>Benito Mussolini</h2>

                    <p>According to Quigley, "one of the most astonishing examples of British 'dual policy' in the
                        appeasement period" occurred when Britain allowed Mussolini to conquer and seize Ethiopia. At
                        the time, the British public was still operating under the assumption that the League of Nations
                        was <em>created</em> to protect the sovereignty of weaker nations. As such, a poll of 11.5
                        million British citizens found that more than 11 million felt Ethiopia should be protected from
                        Italian aggression under the League, 10 million supported economic sanctions against Italy, and
                        more than 6.5 million supported military sanctions if necessary.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"
                            class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

                    <p><em>Prior</em> to this poll, the ruling party in Britain had expressed its indifference regarding
                        the fate of Ethiopia. <em>After</em> the poll, it changed its tune completely. All of a sudden
                        "collective security" and the League of Nations were of the utmost importance in British foreign
                        policy, and new candidates were trotted out to ride the "wave of public support for collective
                        security."<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a> The prime minister and foreign
                        secretary were replaced to "make people believe that the past program of appeasement would be
                        reversed,"<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a> and Quigley provides an example
                        of how the new foreign secretary (Samuel Hoare), fulfilled his part in the deception.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In September, Hoare made a vigorous speech at Geneva in which he pledged Britain's support of
                            collective security to stop the Italian aggression against Ethiopia. The public did not know
                            that he had stopped off in Paris en route to Geneva to arrange a secret deal by which Italy
                            would be given two-thirds of Ethiopia.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>While publicly supporting collective security and sanctions against Italian aggression, the
                            government privately negotiated to destroy the League and to yield Ethiopia to Italy. They
                            were completely successful in this secret policy…In the process they gave the League of
                            Nations, the collective-security system, and the political stability of central Europe their
                            death wounds.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>

                        <p>The consequences of the Ethiopian fiasco were of the greatest importance. Mussolini was much
                            strengthened in Italy [and, as a result of the deceptive "collective-security" election
                            promises] The Conservative Party in England was entrenched in office for a decade, during
                            which it carried out its policy of appeasement and waged the resulting war.<a href="#fn13"

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Quigley doesn't say much about how Mussolini was initially helped into his position of power. A
                        passing comment on page 242 of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> simply states that Mussolini received
                        funding from the Entente governments during World War I, and this funding eventually paved the
                        way for his "unprincipled career which ultimately made him dictator of Italy." However, Quigley
                        <em>does</em> spend a good amount of time describing the rise of General Francisco Franco in
                        Spain.</p>

                    <h2>Francisco Franco</h2>

                    <p>If you'd like to read a short section of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> that covers pretty much every
                        filthy aspect of political power (widespread corruption, gross negligence, secret deals,
                        exploitation of the population, horrendous military waste that benefits a select few,
                        assassinations, overthrowing representative government, etc.), then read pages 586 to 604. In
                        those pages, Quigley covers everything from the Spanish-American War of 1898 to the Franco
                        dictatorship that took over Spain in 1939. Though it's far from uplifting, it's definitely an
                        interesting section of the book.</p>

                    <p>Here, we only need to cover the Franco revolution and his rise to power. On this topic, Quigley
                        first discusses an agreement between Mussolini and "conspirators" seeking to overthrow the
                        Spanish government. He states that Mussolini "promised arms, money, and diplomatic support to
                        the revolutionary movement and gave the conspirators a first-installment payment of 1,500,000
                        pesetas, 10,000 rifles, 10,000 grenades, and 200 machine guns."<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14"
                            class="footnote">[14]</a> So, by this point, the consequences of Britain's appeasement of
                        Mussolini have begun to spill over. (By <em>appeasing</em> the fascist regime of Mussolini,
                        <em>Mussolini</em> gained the freedom to empower another fascist regime in neighboring Spain.)
                    </p>

                    <p>When the Spanish government discovered that General Francisco Franco was conspiring to seize
                        control of the country, it attempted to derail the plot by transferring him to the Canary
                        Islands. But this was little more than a temporary setback. A "well-known editor" in England was
                        able to retrieve Franco from exile, fly him to Morocco, and even supply another fifty machine
                        guns and half a million rounds of ammunition for the coup. After arriving in Morocco, Franco
                        requested and received some assistance from Hitler as well, and by early August 1936, the
                        fascist revolution was well underway.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a> But
                        the Spanish government proved very resilient.</p>

                    <p>Despite assistance from Italy, Germany, and even Portugal, Franco's initial coup was only
                        partially successful. The German secretary of foreign affairs noted as much near the end of
                        August when he wrote: "It is not to be expected that the Franco Government can hold out for
                        long…without large-scale support from outside."<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16"
                            class="footnote">[16]</a> It appeared as if the Spanish government would soon defeat Franco
                        and the rebels. But that was <em>before</em> Britain and France entered the equation with a
                        so-called "nonintervention" agreement.</p>

                    <p>As written, the nonintervention agreement should have helped the Spanish government because it
                        prohibited Italy, Germany, and Portugal from providing any more assistance to Franco and the
                        rebels. Also, the agreement made it <em>seem</em> like Britain was trying to honor the will of
                        its citizens. (By about 8 to 1, the British public supported the Spanish government and opposed
                        the rebels seeking to overthrow it.) The reality, of course, was quite different. Quigley writes
                        that Britain was neither "fair nor neutral" in the way that it enforced the nonintervention
                        agreement, and that Britain engaged "in large-scale violations of international law" (to the
                        benefit of Franco and the rebels), during the course of the Spanish Civil War. He adds:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The nonintervention agreement, as practiced, was neither an aid to peace nor an example of
                            neutrality, but was clearly enforced in such a way as to give aid to the rebels and place
                            all possible obstacles in the way of the [Spanish] government suppressing the rebellion.</p>

                        <p>This attitude of the British government could not be admitted publicly, and every effort was
                            made to picture the actions of the Nonintervention Committee as one of evenhanded
                            neutrality. In fact, the activities of this committee were used to <strong>throw dust in the
                                eyes of the world</strong>, and especially in the eyes of the British public.</p>

                        <p>Britain's attitude was so devious that it can hardly be untangled, although the results are
                            clear enough. The chief result was that in Spain a Left government friendly to France was
                            replaced by a Right government unfriendly to France and deeply obligated to Italy and
                            Germany.</p>

                        <p>When the war ended, much of Spain was wrecked, at least 450,000 Spaniards had been killed…and
                            an unpopular military dictatorship had been imposed on Spain as a result of the actions of
                            non-Spanish forces.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Franco "went on to become the longest-ruling dictator in European history." During his reign, he
                        repealed civil liberties, violently oppressed dissenting voices, and murdered tens of thousands
                        of his political opponents. In power from 1939 until his death in 1975, Franco's funeral was
                        attended not only by fellow Network-supported dictators, but also by such Network royalty as US
                        vice president Nelson Rockefeller.<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a></p>

                    <h2>Adolf Hitler</h2>

                    <p>Although a great deal has been written about Adolf Hitler, you'll rarely find any mention of the
                        Network or its role in the rise of Nazi Germany. The unspeakable human suffering of World War II
                        can hardly be imagined, let alone captured with words, and so there will be no attempt to do so
                        here. Rather, I'll simply provide a few final details about the tactics and policies (enacted by
                        a handful of men) that made the Nazi regime and World War II a reality.</p>

                    <p>After successfully facilitating the remilitarization of Germany, the Network continued moving
                        forward with its plan. That <em>plan</em> included the liquidation of Austria, Czechoslovakia
                        and Poland. However, to assure success, another obstacle to German power had to be removed:
                        France had to be ejected from the western German Rhineland so that German troops could reoccupy
                        the area. On this, Quigley writes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It would be too complicated a story to narrate here the methods by which France was persuaded
                            to yield…It is enough to point out that France was persuaded to withdraw her troops [from
                            the Rhineland] in 1930 rather than 1935 as a result of what she believed to be concessions
                            made to her.<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Here Quigley explains the importance of maintaining a demilitarized Rhineland. Once Germany
                        fortified this area (in violation of the Treaty of Versailles), it could move east into the
                        countries "marked for liquidation" with less fear of a French attack on Germany's western
                        border.<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a></p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The Rhineland and a zone fifty kilometers wide…were to be permanently demilitarized and any
                            violation of this could be regarded as a hostile act by the signers of the treaty. This
                            meant that any <strong>German troops or fortifications were excluded from this area forever.
                                This was the most important clause of the Treaty of Versailles</strong>. So long as it
                            remained in effect…the economic backbone of Germany's ability to wage warfare, was exposed
                            to a quick French military thrust from the west, and Germany could not threaten France or
                            move eastward against Czechoslovakia or Poland if France objected.<a href="#fn21"
                                id="fnref21" class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The French undoubtedly understood the strategic danger of a German-occupied Rhineland when they
                        left the area, but they falsely believed that the Locarno Pacts would prevent Germany from
                        moving troops back in. According to Quigley, this was just another one of the Network's
                        deceptions. The Locarno Pacts were intentionally drawn up with loopholes that would allow
                        Britain to "escape the necessity of fulfilling her guarantee…" Quigley adds:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, when Hitler did violate the Locarno agreements by remilitarizing the
                            Rhineland in March of 1936, the Milner Group and their friends did not even try to evade
                            their obligation by slipping through a loophole…they simply dishonored their agreement.<a
                                href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote">[22]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>With Hitler's Germany successfully returned to the Rhineland, and with the stage set for his
                        conquest of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the Network began dealing with the final
                        obstacle that stood in its way: public opinion. Clearly, the British government couldn't admit
                        its decision to feed three sovereign nations to the Nazis, so to keep public outcry to a
                        minimum, it began manipulating and terrorizing citizens into accepting Hitler's actions.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The chief task of the Milner Group was to see that this devouring process was done no faster
                            than public opinion in Britain could accept, [and also] to soften up the prospective victims
                            so that they would not resist the process and thus precipitate a war.<a href="#fn23"
                                id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a></p>

                        <p>[The British government created fear by] steadily exaggerating Germany's armed might and
                            belittling their own, by calculated indiscretions (like the statement…that there were no
                            real antiaircraft defenses in London), by constant hammering at the danger of an
                            overwhelming air attack without warning, by building ostentatious and quite useless air-raid
                            trenches in the streets and parks of London, and by insisting through daily warnings that
                            everyone must be fitted with a gas mask immediately (although the danger of a gas attack was
                            nil). In this way, the government put London into a panic.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24"
                                class="footnote">[24]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As noted, this tactic of inciting panic (which was gradually built up from 1935 through 1939),
                        was also used on the "prospective victims" of Nazi aggression. Britain applied intense political
                        pressure on the countries that were expected to yield their sovereignty to Hitler, placing
                        special emphasis on an exaggerated account of Germany's military strength and blunt declarations
                        that the victims would be on their own if they chose to resist Hitler's plans. They were led to
                        believe that resistance was futile. They were assured that Britain would <em>not</em> intervene
                        on their behalf.</p>

                    <p>Following this formula, Austria was the first country to fall without a fight. After its
                        annexation, "those who had opposed the Nazis were murdered or enslaved, the Jews were plundered
                        and abused, and extravagant honors were paid to the Nazi gangsters who had been disturbing
                        Austria for years."<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote">[25]</a> Apparently, all of
                        this was OK with the Network, because it immediately began working on the next target;
                        Czechoslovakia.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Within two weeks of Hitler's annexation of Austria, Britain was moving. It was decided to put
                            pressure on the Czechs to make concessions to the Germans…All this was justified by the
                            arguments that Czechoslovakia, in a war with Germany, would be smashed immediately.<a

                    <p>On pages 625 through 639 of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, you'll discover the truly disgraceful
                        step-by-step process that ultimately destroyed Czechoslovakia. Using a combination of "merciless
                        secret pressure," threats, and deception, the Network eventually wore down its opposition and
                        achieved its goal. Though the story is too long to adequately summarize here, suffice to say:
                        one of the most "democratic, prosperous and best-administered" post-WWI nations <em>also</em>
                        fell to the Nazis without a fight, and the predictable consequences followed soon after.</p>

                    <p>Satisfied or not, the issue of liquidating Poland remained on the list of things to do, and this
                        is where the Network's ability to manipulate public opinion began to lose ground. Following
                        Hitler's final annexation of Czechoslovakia and the Memel region of Lithuania, citizens turned
                        downright hostile toward any continued appeasement of the Nazis. Hitler's actions had opened
                        their eyes "to the fact that appeasement was merely a kind of slow suicide, and quite incapable
                        of satisfying the appetites of aggressors who were insatiable."</p>

                    <p>This final realization might have been an epiphany for the average citizen, but "Hitler's real
                        ambitions were quite clear to most men in government" long before his brazen actions in
                        Czechoslovakia, and they "were made clear to the rest during the crisis." Nevertheless,
                        appeasement and concessions to Hitler continued, only now they continued in secrecy.<a

                        story ends.</p>

                    <p>Hitler became progressively more belligerent and impatient, insisting on his right to use force
                        to acquire his desires. According to Quigley, this is the only reason the Network finally turned
                        on him. (It seems they had no problem with Hitler murdering and ruthlessly oppressing people; he
                        had done that from day one of his 1933 German coup. Their main issue, assuming Quigley is
                        correct, was that he refused to be more <em>diplomatic</em> in the way he gained control of the
                        sovereign nations that he intended to oppress.)</p>

                    <p>In the shadow of the League of Nations and world opinion, overt Nazi violations of national
                        sovereignty put increasing pressure on the Network's Western puppets. When Hitler violently
                        attacked Poland in 1939, this finally forced the Network's hand.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29"
                            class="footnote">[29]</a> Thus began a six-year-long "tide of aggression" and "cold-blooded
                        savagery" on a scale that had never been seen before. Civilian deaths far exceeded those of
                        combatants, and many of both "were killed without any military justification" whatsoever. For
                        instance, in the 1939 Battle of Poland, 3.9 <strong><em>million</em></strong> Polish civilians
                        "were executed, or murdered in the ghetto."<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30"
                            class="footnote">[30]</a> As for the <em>total</em> number of civilians killed during the
                        war (in all nations combined), that number has been continually revised upward since the initial
                        release of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>. According to Wikipedia:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Civilians killed totaled from 38 to 55 million, including 13 to 20 million from war-related
                            disease and famine. Total military dead: from 22 to 25 million, including deaths in
                            captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war.<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31"
                                class="footnote">[31]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Accepting the two lowest estimates above, we arrive at sixty million dead. To put that enormous
                        number in perspective, sixty million people taken from the United States would have wiped out
                        nearly half of the 1940 US population. This horrific body count is made even more disturbing
                        when you realize that those most responsible for orchestrating World War II likely walked away
                        with <em>zero</em> casualties.</p>

                    <p>And, once again, the same Network that nurtured and facilitated an unspeakable global disaster
                        profited handsomely. Not just financially via the billions <em>earned</em> and mountains of debt
                        added to government balance sheets, but more so politically. That is, where the Network failed
                        to secure US participation in its League of Nations scheme following WWI, it succeeded in
                        securing US participation in its second global-government scheme (the United Nations) following
                        WWII. This essentially destroyed the problem of American "isolationism." With that out of the
                        way, the United States has done the heavy lifting in the Network's sovereignty-destruction
                        project ever since.</p>

                    <h2>From Global <em>Government</em> to Global <em>Governance</em></h2>

                    <p>Quigley claims that the Network's first global-government scheme (the League of Nations) was
                        never <em>really</em> meant to be used as an instrument of "collective security" or impede
                        sovereignty in any meaningful way. I'd be remiss if I didn't address this foolish assertion.
                        Though Quigley bases his claim on the statements of men within the Network, he again fails to
                        weigh their propensity for deception. Reading between the lines, a much more believable argument
                        emerges. Here, I'll briefly summarize that argument.</p>

                    <p><em>If</em> the United States <em>had agreed</em> to join the League of Nations after WWI, the
                        Network would have gladly begun using the military might, financial resources, and good name of
                        the United States in pursuit of its global objectives. "Obligations" under the League's
                        <em>collective-security</em> agreement would have been invoked when convenient, and ignored when
                        inconvenient. Contrary to Quigley's claim, it isn't that a "League of Coercion" wasn't desired
                        by the Network; it's that such a league <em>required</em> US participation to work. In support
                        of this assertion, consider the following:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The majority of the Network's statements <em>opposing</em> "collective security" came
                            <em>after</em> it was clear that the United States would not join the League and, therefore,
                            would not participate in enforcement. This is when the Network began seriously undermining
                            the League; this is when it decided to embark on its policy of so-called "appeasement." In
                            other words: the Network could not demand that the British protect the sovereignty of
                            nations that it had already decided to allow Hitler, Mussolini, and Spanish rebels to
                            violate. To do so would only turn British power <em>against</em> the Network's own aims.
                        </li>

                        <li>The Network was present every step of the way during the drafting of the League of Nations.
                            It was present every step of the way for the world-wide propaganda campaign in support of
                            the League of Nations. It had every opportunity to speak out against objectionable language
                            or "obligations" under collective security. But again, meaningful opposition didn't come
                            until after the United States refused to join. Why? Well, one quote states that the failure
                            to secure the United States' participation presented "a very serious problem for the British
                            Empire" because, by joining the League without the United States, Britain had "undertaken
                            great obligations" that it now had to "in honesty and self-regard, revise."<a href="#fn32"
                                id="fnref32" class="footnote">[32]</a> Another quote states that once the United States
                            rejected the League "the keystone was taken out of the whole arch of any League of
                            Coercion."<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a></li>

                        <li>There <em>are</em> some specific Network statements against the League serving as "world
                            government," but even these are hedged with qualifiers like "it could be a world government"
                            <em>if</em> given the power to tax citizens and if it "represented" those citizens instead
                            of representing states.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote">[34]</a> (The irony of
                            this sentiment coming from men who set out to destroy "representation," in favor of fascist
                            regimes, is hard to miss.) Another quote simply states that the Milner Group sought to
                            "prevent influential people from using the League as an instrument of world government
                            <em>before</em> popular opinion was <em>ready</em> for a world government."<a href="#fn35"
                                id="fnref35" class="footnote">[35]</a></li>

                        <li>Quigley himself admits that "certain phrases or implications were introduced…which could be
                            taken to indicate that the League might have been intended to be used as a real instrument
                            of collective security, that it might have involved some minute limitation of sovereignty,
                            that sanctions might under certain circumstances be used to protect the peace."<a
                                href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote">[36]</a> He even references a quote that
                            explicitly states "interference with national sovereignty," including "international
                            coercion" would be <em>necessary</em> if a nation refused to cooperate with the League
                            during its ninety-day dispute period,<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote">[37]</a>
                            but he dismisses this in favor of accepting, what I believe was, propaganda aimed at
                            skeptical statesmen. (Specifically, propaganda aimed at skeptical <em>US</em> statesmen.)
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>By now, admittedly, this is a moot point. The League of Nations was replaced by the post-WWII
                        United Nations, and there is absolutely no question regarding how the UN and its related
                        agencies (like the IMF and World Bank) have been used to violate national sovereignty. But even
                        <em>this</em> fact is now fading in relevance, because the Network is seeking to replace the UN
                        with something even more powerful.</p>

                    <p>Quoting from a 2008 CFR program entitled "International Institutions and Global Governance—World
                        Order in the 21st Century":<a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote">[38]</a></p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has launched a comprehensive five-year program on
                            international institutions and global governance. The purpose of this cross-cutting
                            initiative is to explore the institutional requirements for world order in the twenty-first
                            century. The undertaking recognizes that the architecture of global governance—largely
                            reflecting the world as it existed in 1945—has not kept pace with fundamental changes in the
                            international system.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>A twelve-page summary of the project states that "the program draws on the resources of the CFR's
                        David Rockefeller Studies Program" and its purpose is to offer "recommendations" to US
                        policymakers about how to improve the performance of "global governance mechanisms."</p>

                    <p>In order for the United States to assume its proper role in the emerging world order, it targets
                        certain issues that must be dealt with. Issues like US adherence to "constitutional traditions,"
                        "sovereign prerogatives," and "the separation of powers…which gives Congress a critical voice in
                        the ratification of treaties and endorsement of global institutions" all serve to complicate the
                        United States' ability to assume its "new international obligations." Yes, you read that
                        correctly. The Constitution, separation of powers, Congress's voice in the ratification of
                        treaties, and, of course, sovereignty itself are all listed as <em>problems</em> that must be
                        overcome.</p>

                    <p>For those versed in the cynical ways of the Network, the pretexts offered for circumventing
                        constitutional limitations in favor of embracing Network-directed "global governance" will
                        surely make the blood boil. Here are just a few:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>"Managing the global economy" (a pretext for further consolidation and control of the
                            world's monetary system)</li>
                        <li>The recently rebranded "climate change" (a pretext for funding the Network's global
                            government <em>and</em> for centralizing control over the one thing no nation can survive
                            without: <em>energy</em>)</li>
                        <li>"Preventing and responding to violent conflict" ("violent conflict" is often <em>caused</em>
                            by the Network itself and then used as a pretext for intervention and interference with
                            national sovereignty)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>However, the pretext that jumps out the most, the one that actually mocks the reader's
                        intelligence, is the "struggle against al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations."</p>

                    <p>The Network has funded, trained, and armed terrorists in pursuit of its global objectives for
                        decades. This <em>fact</em> can be easily verified by researching any number of historical
                        events. Whether it's Operation Ajax in 1953, or Operation Cyclone in 1979, or Bosnia and Kosovo
                        in the 1990s, or Libya and Syria in 2011 and 2013, respectively…in each case the
                        <em>terrorists</em> found aid and comfort by turning to the West.</p>

                    <p>None of this is mentioned, of course, in the CFR white paper. However, it does admit that the
                        rise of transnational terrorist organizations has "forced the United States and its allies to
                        tolerate some sacrifice of national sovereignty [and] reconcile distinct constitutional and
                        legal traditions." Rather convenient.</p>

                    <p>In the final chapters, we'll delve deeper into Network-sponsored acts of terrorism, which are
                        often referred to as "false flag" operations. Keep in mind: although these acts are directed by
                        Western-government institutions, the <em>vast majority</em> of the military, political
                        leadership, and civilian population is never told the truth about what "their government" is
                        doing.</p>
