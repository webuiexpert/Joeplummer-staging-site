  <h1>CHAPTER THREE<br>The Bailout</h1>
</div>

<div class="Chapter-content">

          <p>Enough with the <em>setup</em>, let's take a look at the Federal Reserve System in action. Limiting our
            focus to a period of roughly 20 years (1970 through 1990), we'll pick out some of the more interesting and
            well-documented bailouts.</p>

          <p>While reading, keep in mind that there are bigger and better bailouts in the works right now. As long as
            it's profitable for the financial elite to make these kinds of "mistakes," the stories that follow will
            never end.</p>

          <h2>Penn Central Railroad</h2>

          <p>In 1970, Penn Central was America's largest railroad. It employed 96,000 people, had a weekly payroll of
            $20 million, and was on the verge of bankruptcy. If ever there was a candidate for a "protect the public"
            bailout, this was it.</p>

          <p>One thing to keep in mind as we proceed: Many of the large banks that loaned Penn Central into inescapable
            debt also had bank officers on Penn Central's board of directors. In other words, Penn Central was
            "mismanaged into insolvency" by the very banks it owed money to. They helped dig the giant hole from which
            the company (and the bankers) would eventually be rescued. The House Banking and Currency Committee
            Chairman, Wright Patman, conducted an investigation in 1972 and found (paraphrased):</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The banks provided large loans for disastrous expansion and diversification projects. They loaned
              additional millions to the railroad so it could pay dividends to its stockholders. This <strong>created
                the false appearance of prosperity and artificially inflated the market price of its stock</strong> long
              enough to dump it on the unsuspecting public. Thus, the banker-managers were able to engineer a three-way
              bonanza for themselves. They: (1) received dividends on essentially worthless stock, (2) earned interest
              on the loans which provided the money to pay those dividends, and (3) were able to unload 1.8 million
              shares of stock—after the dividends, of course— at unrealistically high prices.<a href="#fn1"
                id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>If Penn Central had been permitted to go into bankruptcy, the bankers would have still been protected. The
            company's assets would have been sold off, and, as in any liquidation, the banks would have been paid first.
            The stockholders, on the other hand, could only hope to get some scraps (if anything remained at all) after
            the company's debts had been cleared. (Knowing this, the individual bankers who engineered the crisis had
            already dumped most of their stock prior to public disclosure of the railroad's problems.)</p>

          <p>But why go the bankruptcy route? The Federal Reserve System was created precisely for this kind of
            situation.</p>

          <p>In waves, they descended on Congress; Penn Central's executives, bankers, union representatives, even the
            Navy Department, all speaking of the dire threat to the public interest — even national security — should
            Penn Central be allowed to go under. Congress patriotically responded by ordering an immediate pay raise of
            13.5% for all union employees, adding yet another financial burden to the already failed company. And with
            the Emergency Rail Services Act, they authorized $125 million in federal loan guarantees.</p>

          <p>Of course, neither of these moves solved the underlying cause of Penn's financial problems, and the
            railroad was nationalized ("a euphemism for becoming a black hole into which tax dollars disappear")<a
              href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a> in 1971. By 1973, it had been split into two
            divisions: Amtrak and Conrail. Amtrak handled passenger services and Conrail handled freight.</p>

          <p>Congress dumped $21 billion into Amtrak by 1998, and despite this, its liabilities <em>still</em> exceeded
            its assets by roughly $14 billion. In 2002, it was burning through roughly $25,000 per hour (24 hours a day,
            seven days a week) of taxpayers' money.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, the government sold Conrail in 1987. Since returning to the private sector, it has managed to
            turn a profit. Now it pays taxes instead of just consuming them.</p>

          <h2>Lockheed</h2>

          <p>Also in 1970, the nation's largest defense contractor, Lockheed Corporation, found itself mired in nearly
            half a billion dollars of debt. To save the giant from bankruptcy and, of course, to save the banks from
            losing a huge asset and stream of income, a group of concerned interests descended on Congress. The banks,
            Lockheed management, stockholders, and labor unions all explained how jobs would be lost, sub-contractors
            would be put out of business, and national security jeopardized if Lockheed was unable to borrow more money
            and fast. (Money that no bank wanted to loan absent a government guarantee.)</p>

          <p>The government responded with a bailout plan of $250 million in loan guarantees, increasing the company's
            debt by over 50%. Under normal circumstances, this additional debt burden would have put the company at
            greater risk of insolvency, but not in this case. Why?</p>

          <p>Because now the government was on the hook for $250 million. It had a major incentive to steer lucrative
            defense contracts to Lockheed so it could pay its bills. Again, rewarding failure and punishing success.</p>

          <p>Those contractors that operated their business more efficiently didn't have the added leverage of saying,
            "If we fail, then you (the government) have to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars." It would be
            foolish to think that didn't come into play when deciding who was awarded a contract and who wasn't.</p>

          <p>Lockheed did eventually pay back its loans, but did it matter?</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>[E]very bit of the money used to pay back the loans came from defense contracts which were awarded by the
              same government which was guaranteeing those loans. ... Taxpayers were doomed to pay the bill either
              way.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>First Pennsylvania Bank</h2>

          <p>When a bank has loaned itself so far into a hole it cannot escape, the FDIC has a few ways it can
            intervene:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The <em>payoff</em> option: Insured depositors are paid off, the bank is allowed to slide into
              bankruptcy, and its assets are liquidated. If you're a small bank with no political clout, this is what
              you're likely to get.</li>
            <li>The <em>sell-off</em> option: The insured depositors are paid off and arrangements are made to have a
              larger bank assume control of the failed bank's assets and liabilities. The bank's name changes, but there
              is no interruption in service and few people notice what has occurred. Maybe you're a medium-sized bank;
              maybe you've got a little more clout. In either case, this is a better option if you can get it.</li>
            <li>The <em>bailout</em> option: The bank does not close and <em>all</em> depositors (insured and not
              insured) are paid off. If you're fortunate enough to secure this option, odds are you're a very large and
              well-connected bank.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The significance of all depositors being paid off is this: Large banks are apt to have many uninsured
            accounts. (That is, accounts exceeding $250,000 each and accounts held outside the U.S.) Since the FDIC only
            charges participating banks a percentage of insured deposits, the large bank ends up collecting on insurance
            it never had to pay for.</p>

          <p>That huge savings gives an even bigger competitive edge to the larger banks. But that should come as no
            surprise; it's exactly the way the Jekyll Island group wanted it.</p>

          <p>As you might have guessed by now, First Pennsylvania Bank was a <em>big</em> bank. In 1980, with assets
            exceeding $9 billion, it ranked 23rd in the nation. After bungling itself into insolvency, its final move
            was predictable. (The bankers went to Washington with their bailout request.) If warnings of catastrophic
            consequences in Philadelphia were not enough, they spun tales of an international financial crisis should
            First Penn not be saved. First Penn, they claimed, would act as the first falling domino in a string of
            collapses that would circle the entire globe.</p>

          <p>Needless to say, nobody wanted the blame for allowing such a catastrophe. The FDIC responded with a
            one-year, $325 million, interest-free loan. That, by itself, saved First Penn millions of dollars. After the
            interest-free year, the loan converted to about half the market rate (millions more saved).</p>

          <p>Banks that were tied to First Penn loaned an additional $175 million and offered a $1 billion line of
            credit. (The FDIC insisted on this move. It wanted to show that the banking industry had faith in the
            bailout.) The Federal Reserve offered those banks low interest funds to make sure there was plenty of faith
            to go around. In the end, failure was again rewarded, and everyone made lots of money (except the citizens
            who subsidized it all).</p>

          <h2>Continental Illinois</h2>

          <p>Sad to say, First Penn was literally child's play compared to Continental Illinois. With 12,000 employees,
            offices in countries all around the world, and $42 billion in assets, it ranked seventh in the nation. For a
            while, it seemed unstoppable.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>[Continental Illinois'] net income on loans had doubled in just five years and by 1981 had rocketed to an
              annual figure of $254 million. It had become the darling of the market analysts and had been named by
              <em>Dun's</em> Review as one of the five best managed companies in the country. These opinion leaders
              failed to perceive that the spectacular performance was due, not to an expertise in banking or investment,
              but to financing shaky business enterprises and foreign governments that could not obtain loans anywhere
              else.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a>
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Continental Illinois invested heavily in Argentina, Mexico, and a string of high-risk businesses. In 1982,
            as the Argentine and Mexican debt crisis came to a head and a series of corporations went into bankruptcy,
            the bank was hit hard.</p>

          <p>But just as Penn Central Railroad had done 12 years earlier, the bank did all it could to project an image
            of "business as usual." It continued to pay dividends that it really couldn't afford, and it made good use
            of what the bank's chairman called "The Continental Illinois Reassurance Brigade." (That would be the bank's
            employees, all around the world, doing what they could to calm the nerves of its depositors and
            stockholders.)</p>

          <p>The move worked for a while, but by 1984 the bank's bad loans had reached $2.7 billion, and that figure was
            growing. With literally hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue, paying stockholders and maintaining
            an image of prosperity was becoming increasingly difficult. It was just a matter of time. News of the bank's
            shaky financial situation began to trickle out — a rumor here, a rumor there — and before long, the
            floodgates were blown wide open.</p>

          <h2>The world's first electronic bank run</h2>

          <p>To see Continental Illinois from the outside, you'd never know what was happening. You'd never know, as the
            sun rose on Wednesday May 9, 1984, that a bank run of historic proportions was underway. On that one day, $1
            billion in Asian money was withdrawn silently, electronically. By Friday, the bank was forced to borrow $3.6
            billion from The Federal Reserve to cover escalating withdrawals, and by the following Friday, total
            withdrawals exceeded $6 billion!</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Continental run was like some modernistic fantasy: there were no throngs of hysterical depositors,
              just cool nightmare flashes on computer screens. -- Ron Chernow</p>

            <p>Inside the bank, all was calm, the teller lines moved as always, and bank officials recall no visible
              sign of trouble—except in the wire room. Here the employees knew what was happening as withdrawal order
              after order moved on the wire, bleeding Continental to death. -- Irvine Sprague<a href="#fn5"
                id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Now is a good time to mention: If Continental would have been allowed to collapse, its stockholders would
            have been wiped out, its depositors would have lost a fortune, and the financial world would have been badly
            shaken. But who says that would have been a bad thing?</p>

          <p>The losses would have stirred anger, and the anger would have driven demands for change. It would be near
            impossible to hide and excuse the inherently fraudulent nature of the system under such scrutiny and
            legitimate outrage. The long-term benefits to our nation (of undoing the flawed system) would have been
            enormous. But no such thing was ever considered. The banking elite created our system for a reason, and this
            was it. It was time for the Fed and FDIC to work their magic, which means it was time for the citizens to
            pay.</p>

          <p>Earlier, we mentioned large banks are most likely to be bailed out (have <em>all</em> their depositors paid
            off) and are also most likely to benefit the most from a bailout as they're apt to carry many uninsured
            deposits. Continental proved to be a shining example. A full 96% of Continental's exposure was uninsured
            when help arrived. Or to put it another way, the bank only paid to insure 4%, but now, "to protect the
            public," it would be covered 100%.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The final bailout package was a whopper. Basically, the government took over Continental Illinois and
              assumed all of its losses. Specifically, the FDIC took $4.5 billion in bad loans and paid Continental $3.5
              billion for them. The difference was made up by the infusion of $1 billion in fresh capital in the form of
              stock purchase. The bank, therefore, now had the government as a stockholder controlling 80 percent of its
              shares, and its bad loans had been dumped onto the taxpayer. ... By 1984, ["unlimited liquidity support"
              had translated into the staggering sum of $8 billion.] By early 1986, the figure had climbed to $9.24
              billion and was still rising. While explaining this fleecing of the taxpayer to the Senate Banking
              Committee, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker said: "The operation is the most basic function of the Federal
              Reserve. It was why it was founded."<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Behind the creation of all this money sat the Federal Reserve System. Interesting that the Fed is known as
            the "lender of last resort," when, in reality, it has no money to lend. No money, that is, until it creates
            some out of thin air, pours it into our economy, and through the hidden tax of inflation, confiscates
            purchasing power right out of our pockets.</p>

          <p>As G. Edward Griffin explains, "The system was created at Jekyll Island to manufacture whatever amount of
            money might be necessary to cover the losses of the cartel."<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7"
              class="footnote">[7]</a> And that is exactly what it does — for the "big guys." If you're a little guy,
            don't expect any favors.</p>

          <p>During the first six months of 1984, while Continental was getting the royal treatment, 43 smaller banks
            learned the following lesson firsthand: As a small bank, the only deposits that are covered are the ones you
            paid to insure, and you can rest assured you won't receive any bailout offers. If you're in trouble, you've
            got little choice but to sell out to a larger bank. (Score another advantage for the Jekyll Island
            conspirators. Drive out or buy out the competition; either way, they win.)</p>

          <h2>The housing market</h2>

          <p>Up until now, we've seen how the penalties of mismanagement and fraud (in business and banking) can be
            turned into great rewards. Now we'll have a look at the Savings and Loan industry (S&L) and how government
            promises of "a house on every lot" led to S&L bailouts of epic proportions. Suffice to say, "You ain't seen
            nothin' yet."</p>

          <p>During the Great Depression, Marxists blamed the capitalist system for the country's dire financial
            situation. Spreading visions of a socialist utopia, they were starting to gain popular support.</p>

          <p>Many of our nation's politicians, formerly champions of personal responsibility and individualism, quickly
            learned the advantages of preaching government paternalism. Suddenly, pushing socialist policies in America
            became politically profitable. And there seemed to be something in it for everybody.</p>

          <p>The elites were more than happy to consider implementing a planned economy. After all, it was they (the
            wealthy and well-connected intellectuals) who would be in charge of the planning.</p>

          <p>The politicians had everything to gain. They could vastly expand the power and control of government,
            which, in turn, increased their own power and control.</p>

          <p>Last but not least, a large percentage of the population (financially crushed and demoralized by what they
            were told was the "instability of the free market") was ready to accept just about anything. Many Americans
            were ruined by the Depression; it wasn't too hard to sell the idea of a little government help.</p>

          <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) came to represent the epitome of the new American politician.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Earlier in his political career, he had been the paragon of free enterprise and individualism. He spoke
              out against big government and for the free market, but in mid life he reset his sail to catch the
              shifting political wind. He went down in history as a pioneer of socialism in America. ... While the
              Marxists were promising a chicken in every pot, [Roosevelt's] New Dealers were winning elections by
              pushing for a house on every lot.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Through the FHA (Federal Housing Authority), private home loans would now be subsidized by the federal
            government. At first, many people who couldn't afford a home did benefit from FHA assistance. However, it
            wasn't long before these new FHA-subsidized buyers began to drive up the price of homes, and that offset any
            real advantage.</p>

          <p>In another step to help the housing market, commercial banks were legally required to pay less interest to
            their depositors than S&Ls.</p>

          <p>This policy attracted more deposits for S&Ls, and since the S&Ls were legally limited to issuing home
            loans, it increased the amount of money available for home loans. Unfortunately, it simultaneously decreased
            the amount of loan capital available for all other industries. (Great if your business is part of the home
            industry; not so great for everyone else competing for the same investment dollars.)</p>

          <p>It was also about this time the FDIC and the FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) first
            came into being. If there were to be losses, the people no longer had to worry. "The government would pay
            for it." Too few realized, then as today, that the government doesn't pay for anything. Every dollar is
            confiscated in one way or another from what others have earned. Consider the irony of government forcing you
            to give it money (or taking it through inflation) so it can "protect you" from losing your money.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, government "solutions<em>"</em> are always wasteful and often counterproductive. Even if you
            accept the idea that government programs and policies are intended to serve us (rather than intended to
            secure and expand the power of the elite), you don't have to be a genius to calculate the dismal results.
          </p>

          <p>The war on drugs, the war on terror, a house on every lot — whatever solution the government comes up with,
            it tends to create more problems than it solves. And with more problems come more proposed solutions, more
            demands for increased funding, more demands for greater control. Basically, the more the government fails,
            the more money and power it confiscates. If those who benefit from this backward system aren't failing on
            purpose, they ought to be.</p>

          <p>The consequences of government meddling in the housing market took a long time to manifest, but by the time
            they arrived, the results were disastrous. The costs of complying with government regulations alone have
            been estimated at 60% of ALL S&L profits. In addition:</p>

            <p>[The] healthy component of the industry must spend over a billion dollars each year for extra premiums
              into the so-called insurance fund to make up for the failures of the unhealthy component, a form of
              penalty for success. When some of the healthy institutions attempted to convert to banks to escape this
              penalty, the regulators said no. Their cash flow was needed to support the bailout fund.<a href="#fn9"
                id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, the S&Ls (to continue attracting depositors) had to
            offer more attractive rates themselves. By December of 1980, S&Ls were paying nearly 16% on their short-term
            deposits.</p>

          <p>This would be fine if they then loaned that money out at a higher percentage, but they didn't. In fact, the
            average rate they were earning on new mortgage loans was only 12.9%. Worse, many of their old mortgage loans
            were only producing 7% or 8%, and still others were in default (paying nothing at all.) Simple math
            illustrates the S&Ls were already broke and only going deeper in the hole.</p>

          <p>Under normal conditions, few people would want to put their money in a failing institution. But with S&L
            deposits fully insured, "normal conditions" didn't exist. The only thing that mattered to those making
            deposits was that hefty 16% risk-free return on their money. Investment managers with huge blocks of cash to
            invest were especially happy with the arrangement. Backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S.
            government, there was nothing to lose and everything to gain by putting their money into the S&Ls.</p>

          <p>By now, we all know what backs the full faith and credit of the federal government. Consumer Reports, wise
            to the scheme, put it this way: "Behind the troubled banks ... stands "the full faith and credit" of the
            [g]overnment—in effect, a promise, sure to be honored by Congress, that all citizens will chip in through
            taxes or inflation to make all depositors whole."<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>

          <p>Using clever accounting techniques (read that as "fraudulent accounting techniques"), an all-out effort to
            make the S&Ls look healthy and prosperous was put into play. This only postponed the inevitable and greatly
            increased the final carnage.</p>

          <p>Over a period of just six years (1980–1986), 664 insured S&Ls went belly-up. The government, true to form,
            was in way over its head. It simply couldn't afford to close all the thrifts because it didn't have the
            funds to pay off their depositors. In March of 1986, the FSLIC had only three pennies for every dollar of
            insured deposits. Just prior to 1987, that dropped to <strong>two-tenths of one penny</strong> for every
            dollar.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Keeping the S&Ls in business was costing the FSLIC $6 million per day. By 1988 ... the thrift industry as
              a whole was losing $9.8 million per day, and the unprofitable ones—the corpses which were propped up by
              the FSLIC—were losing $35.6 million per day. And, still, the game continued.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11"
                class="footnote">[11]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>By 1989, the FSLIC had nothing; it too was insolvent. It was time for government to spring into action
            (and, boy, did it). With the passage of the FIRREA,<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a>
            $300 billion was allocated to "protect the public" — $225 billion would come directly from taxes or
            inflation, and $75 billion would be siphoned off the healthy savings and loans. It was by far the biggest
            bailout ever.</p>

          <p>And, of course, with the enormous failure came an excuse to add more controls (more government) to the
            whole inexcusable mess. We now would have the Resolution Trust Oversight Board, the Resolution Funding
            Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Oversight Board for the Home Loan Banks. On signing
            the bill, President Bush (Sr.) proudly announced:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This legislation will safeguard and stabilize America's financial system and put in place permanent
              reforms so these problems will never happen again. Moreover, it says to tens of millions of
              savings-and-loan depositors, "You will not be the victim of others' mistakes. We will see—guarantee—that
              your insured deposits are secure.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Would you be surprised to discover the bailout estimate was a little low? Probably not since Congress
            always gives lowball estimates to get their bills passed. (Once a bill is signed into law, the figures tend
            to adjust themselves upward.)</p>

          <p>How much is a little low? $10 billion? $25 billion? $100 billion? No, more like $225 billion. Yep, by the
            time all was said and done, the total bailout cost sat at just over half a trillion dollars. (Roughly $525
            billion total.) It sure is good to know that we "will not be the victim of others' mistakes."</p>

          <h2>Cooking the books</h2>

          <p>The world of government regulation is truly a sight to behold. Blatant criminal activity (if you or I did
            it) becomes an accepted way of doing business when government regulators are at the helm. Now is as good a
            time as any to provide some examples of how the government helped the S&Ls cook the books.</p>

          <p>Cooking the books is all about making income or assets look bigger than they actually are. (It can also
            include making liabilities and losses look smaller than they actually are, but for now let's focus on the
            assets end.)</p>

          <p>Any fool knows it's great to have assets, and the S&Ls needed all the assets they could get. So, the
            government decided it was OK for the S&Ls to put a dollar value on the amount of "community good will" they
            had. (That is not a joke.) Poof, just like that they created $2.5 billion worth of assets for themselves.
            Add it to the books!</p>

          <p>The S&Ls had another serious asset problem: upside-down loans. In other words, Pete borrowed $125,000 to
            purchase his home, but because of falling real estate prices, Pete's house was now only worth about $85,000.
          </p>

          <p>In the real world, the S&L only had an asset worth $85,000 backing the $125,000 loan. That little
            inconvenience was overcome by allowing them to ignore true market value and instead list value based on the
            original loan amount. Add it to the books!</p>

          <p>We know the FSLIC had promised to bail out the ailing S&Ls should they get themselves into trouble. Surely
            there were some assets that could be squeezed out of that arrangement, right? Absolutely! Certificates of
            net worth were issued based on the government's promise to pay, and the S&Ls were allowed to then list the
            value of those certificates as assets. Add it to the books!</p>

          <p>However, try as they might, clever accounting tricks (fraud) can only achieve so much.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The moment of truth arrives when the S&Ls have to liquidate some of their holdings, such as in the sale
              of their mortgages or foreclosed homes[.] ... That is when the inflated bookkeeping value is converted
              into the true market value, and the difference has to be entered into the ledger as a loss. But not in the
              never-never land of socialism where government is the great protector. Dennis Turner explains:</p>

            <p>The FSLIC permits the S&L which sold the mortgage to take the loss over a 40-year period. Most companies
              selling an asset at a loss must take the loss immediately: only S&Ls can engage in this patent fraud. Two
              failing S&Ls could conceivably sell their lowest-yielding mortgages to one another, and both would raise
              their net worth! This dishonest accounting in the banking system is approved by the highest regulatory
              authorities.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote">[14]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>A lot of people have heard of the Savings and Loan crisis; some might even understand who has ultimately
            had to pay the costs of others' mistakes, but too few have heard about the role government played in the
            scandal. That of course should come as no surprise. Nor should it come as a surprise there aren't calls in
            Congress for a full investigation into what caused the disaster.</p>

          <p>Banks, S&Ls, and other federally regulated industries contribute large amounts of cash to the election
            campaigns of those who write our regulatory laws. No need to start poking around there. Economist Hans
            Sennholz summed up the S&L debacle this way:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The real cause of the disaster is the very financial structure that was fashioned by legislators and
              guided by regulators; they together created a cartel that, like all other monopolistic concoctions, is
              playing mischief with its victims.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>And G. Edward Griffin agrees:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Savings and Loan industry, is really a cartel <em>within</em> a cartel. It could not function without
              Congress standing by to push unlimited amounts of money into it. And Congress could not do that without
              the banking cartel called the Federal Reserve System standing by as the "lender of last resort" to create
              money out of nothing for Congress to borrow. This comfortable arrangement between political scientists and
              monetary scientists permits Congress to vote for any scheme it wants, regardless of the cost. If
              politicians tried to raise that money through taxes, they would be thrown out of office. But being able to
              "borrow" it from the Federal Reserve System ... allows them to collect it through the hidden mechanism of
              inflation, and not one voter in a hundred will complain.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16"
                class="footnote">[16]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Now, fast forward to September of 2008, and we arrive at the <em>biggest and best</em> financial crisis
            ever engineered. Predictably, we also arrive at the biggest and best banker bailout ever stolen from the
            pockets of U.S. taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Despite massive public opposition, on October 3, 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was able to ram a
            $<strong>700 billion</strong> Troubled Asset Relief Program through Congress. (Intense pressure from voters
            had initially defeated efforts to enact the TARP legislation. It seems Paulson overcame that pressure by
            telling legislators there would be chaos in the streets, and even martial law if they refused to pass the
            bill.)<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a></p>

          <p>Sadly, $700 billion is peanuts compared to the total economic impact attributed to the 2008 financial
            crisis. Estimates put the real damage at over $5 trillion. To give you an idea of how much money that is, if
            you saved $1 million per day, it would take you nearly 14,000 years to recoup $5 trillion.</p>

          <p>So far, we've witnessed how the bailout game is played. We've seen failure and fraud rewarded,
            accountability avoided, and the enormous costs heaped onto the backs of the American people.</p>

          <p>Would you believe me if I said everything outlined until now is only a small part of the game? It's true.
            And in the next few chapters we're going to highlight the real objectives of the system and the unspeakable
            costs of allowing it to survive.</p>
