                        Western civilization…the Industrial Revolution so lowered the cost of firearms that the ordinary
                        citizen of western Europe and of North American could acquire the most effective weapon existing
                        (the musket). As a result of this, and other factors, democracy came to these areas along with
                        mass

                        <strong>Banking dynasties, Rothschild inbreeding, secrecy and deceit, controlling business and
                            government, Morgan and Rockefeller control.</strong> <strong>Note to self</strong>: In this
                        21-page section of the book, Quigley admits that bankers "use deception." Unfortunately, it
                        apparently didn't occur to Quigley that he too might have been deceived. He suggests that the
                        banker's power peaked in the early 1930's (and moved toward "monopoly capitalism" controlled by
                        the
                        Rockefeller block, page 76.) But that's when they began transitioning the world over to a purely
                        fiat, debt-based system. With that done, they could now create, destroy, and direct as much
                        money as
                        they wanted. The limits of gold were gone. This was a leap toward greater power, not less.) He
                        bases
                        his conclusion on an inaccurate assumption; that they were trying to keep, rather than destroy,
                        the
                        gold standard.
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">51</span>, paragraph 2: "In time, they brought into their financial
                        network
                        the provincial banking centers…as well as insurance companies, to form all of these into a
                        single
                        financial system on an international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money so
                        that
                        they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the
                        other.
                        The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of dynastic monarchy in which they had
                        their own roots, aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least as
                        successful at this as were many of the dynastic political rulers. The greatest of these
                        dynasties,
                        of course, were the descendants of Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743 – 1812) …whose male
                        descendants,
                        for at least two generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces."</p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">53</span>, paragraph 2: To achieve their ends, "…it was necessary to
                        conceal,
                        or even to mislead, both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of
                        operation."</p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">55</span>, paragraph 3: "In most countries, the central bank was
                        surrounded
                        closely by the almost invisible private investment banking firms. These…could hardly be seen in
                        the
                        dazzle emitted by the central bank which they, in fact, often dominated. Yet a close observer
                        could
                        hardly fail to notice the close <em>private</em> associations between these private
                        international
                        bankers and the central bank itself." (Emphasis in original)</p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">60</span>, paragraph 3: "…the Money Power controlled by the international
                        investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and government. They could dominate
                        business, because investment bankers had the ability to supply or refuse (needed) capital. Thus,
                        Rothschild interests came to dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan dominated at
                        least 26,000 miles of American railroads. Such bankers went further than this. …they took seats
                        on
                        the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had already done on commercial banks,
                        saving
                        banks, insurance firms and finance companies." They provided money to businesses that agreed to
                        yield control and kept it from "those who resisted."</p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">61</span>, paragraph 1: "As early as 1909, Walther Rathenau, who was in a
                        position to know…said 'Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic
                        destiny
                        of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves.'" Paragraph 3: "On September 26,
                        1921,
                        <em>The Financial Times</em> wrote, "Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could
                        upset
                        the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.'"
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">62</span>, paragraph 2: "In addition to their power over government based
                        on
                        government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished
                        them to go by other pressures. Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they
                        sought
                        advice from bankers whom they considered to be experts in the field. The history of the last
                        century
                        shows…that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice they gave to
                        industrialists,
                        was consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen, and
                        the
                        people generally. Such advice could be enforced if necessary by manipulation of exchanges, gold
                        flows, discount rates, and even levels of business activity."</p>

                    <p><span class="page-ref">72</span>, paragraph 2: "The structure of financial controls created by
                        the
                        tycoons of "Big Banking" and "Big Business" in the period 1880 – 1933 was of extraordinary
                        complexity, one business fief being built on another, allied with semi-independent associates,
                        the
                        whole rearing upward into two pinnacles of economic and financial power…one, centered in New
                        York,
                        headed by J.P. Morgan and Company, and the other, in Ohio, headed by the Rockefeller family.
                        When
                        these two cooperated, as they generally did, they could influence the economic life of the
                        country
                        to a large degree and could almost control its political life, at least on the Federal level."
                        Paragraph 3: "The influence of these business leaders was so great that (they) could have
                        wrecked
                        the economic system of the country merely by throwing securities on the stock market for sale,
                        and,
                        having precipitated a stock-market panic, could then have bought back the securities…but at a
                        lower
                        price. Naturally, they were not so foolish as to do this, although Morgan came very close to it
                        in
                        precipitating the 'panic of 1907,' but they did not hesitate to wreck individual corporations…by
                        driving them to bankruptcy."</p>

                        both

                        alternation of the two parties in public office in order to conceal their own influence, inhibit
                        any
                        exhibition of independence by politicians, and allow the (voters) to believe that they were

                        did
                        not cease their efforts to control both. In fact on two occasions, in 1904 and in 1924, J.P.
                        Morgan
                        was able to sit back with a feeling of satisfaction to watch a presidential election in which
                        the
                        candidates of both parties were in his sphere of influence…Usually, Morgan had to share his
                        political influence with other sectors of the business oligarchy, especially with Rockefeller
                        interest (as was done, for example, by dividing the ticket between them in 1900 and in 1920.)"
                        <strong>Note to self:</strong> Admits that they had the power to control elections and divide
                        the
                        ticket, misses the election of 1912 somehow.

                        restricted
                        for many years on a property basis, so that, in 1900, only one person in a hundred had the right
                        to
                        vote. The close alliance between the Meiji oligarchy and the richest members of the expanding
                        economic system made it perfectly easy to control the flow of campaign contributions. And if
                        these
                        two methods failed, the Meiji oligarchy controlled both the police and the prefectural

                        on the side of the Entente Powers in April 1917. The causes of this intervention
                        have been analyzed at great length…These might be summarized as follows: (1) The
                        German submarine attacks on neutral shipping made it necessary for the United
                        States to go to war to secure ‘freedom of the seas’; (2) the United States was
                        influenced by subtle British propaganda conducted in drawing rooms,
                        universities, and the press of the eastern part of the country where
                        Anglophilism was rampant among the more influential social groups; (3) the
                        United States was inveigled into the war by a conspiracy of international
                        bankers and munitions manufacturers eager to protect their loans to the Entente
                        Powers or their wartime profits from sales to these Powers; and (4) Balance of
                        Power principles made it impossible for the United States to allow Great Britain

                        fact that the Anglo-Saxon heritage of the United States and the Anglophilism of
                        its influential class made it impossible for the average American to see world
                        events except through the spectacles made by British propaganda, the fact that
                        Americans had lent the Entente billions of dollars which would be jeopardized by
                        German victory, the fact that the enormous inflation which would collapse the

                        foundation on which they could work…The unconscious assumption by American
                        leaders that an Entente victory was both necessary and inevitable was at the
                        bottom of their failure to enforce the same rules of neutrality and
                        international law against Britain as against Germany…..Since they could not
                        admit this unconscious assumption or publicly defend the legitimate basis of
                        international power politics on which it rested, they finally went to war on an
                        excuse which was legally weak, although emotionally satisfying. As John Bassett
                        Moore, America’s most famous international lawyer, put it, ‘What most decisively
                        contributed to the involvement of the United States in the war was the assertion
                        of a right to protect belligerent ships on which Americans saw fit to travel and
                        the treatment of armed belligerent merchantmen as peaceful vessels…’”

                        tried to use the established rules of international law regarding destruction of
                        merchant vessels.” But because of the difficulty of doing so (note from page 239
                        above) “…most German submarines tended to attack without warning. American
                        protests reached a peak when the

                        sunk in this way nine miles off the English coast on May 7, 1915. The

                        <strong>256</strong>, paragraph 3, Suspending the gold standard allowed the war to go
                        on much longer: “The magnitude of the war and the fact that it might last for
                        more than six months were quite unexpected for both sides…In July 1914, the
                        military men were confident that a decision would be reached in six months…This
                        belief was supported by the financial experts who, while greatly underestimating
                        the cost of fighting, were confident that the financial resources of all states
                        would be exhausted in six months. By ‘financial resources’ they meant the gold
                        reserves of the various nations. These were clearly limited; all the Great
                        Powers were on the gold standard under which bank notes and paper money could be
                        converted into gold on demand. However, each country suspended the gold standard
                        at the outbreak of war. This removed the automatic limitation on the supply of
                        paper money…each country proceeded to pay for the war by borrowing from the
                        banks. The banks created the money which they lent by merely giving the
                        government a deposit of any size against which the government could draw checks.
                        The banks were no longer limited in the amount of credit they could create
                        because they no longer had to pay out gold for checks on demand.” As a result,
                        “inflation became acute.”

                        essential raw materials and allot them to manufacturers who had war contracts

                        censorship, propaganda, and curtailment of civil liberties. These were
                        established in all countries…The British censorship was established on August 5,
                        1914, and at once intercepted all cables and private mail which it could reach,
                        including that of neutral countries…A Press Censorship Committee was set up in

                        control almost all information going to the American press, and by 1916 was
                        acting as an international news service itself…”
                        <strong>Paragraph 2</strong>: “The Censorship and Propaganda bureaus worked together
                        in Britain
                        as well as elsewhere. The former concealed all stories of Entente violations of
                        the laws of war or of the rules of humanity…or their own war plans and less
                        altruistic war aims, while the Propaganda Bureau widely publicized the
                        violations and crudities of the Central Powers…In general, manufacture of
                        outright lies by propaganda agencies was infrequent, and the desired picture of
                        the enemy was built up by a process of selection and distortion of evidence…A
                        great deal was made, especially by the British, of ‘atrocity’ propaganda;
                        stories of German mutilation of bodies, violation of women, cutting off
                        children’s hands, desecration of churches and shrines, and crucifixions of
                        Belgians were widely believed in the West by 1916. Lord Bryce headed a committee
                        which produced a volume of such stories in 1915, and it is quite evident that
                        this well-educated man….was completely taken in by his own stories. Here, again,
                        outright manufacture of falsehoods was infrequent, although General Henry
                        Charteris in 1917 created a story that the Germans were cooking human bodies to
                        extract glycerin, and produced pictures to prove it.”

                        American loans, Germany was able to rebuild her industrial system to make it the
                        second best in the world by a wide margin, to keep up her prosperity and her
                        standard of living in spite of the defeat and reparations, and to pay
                        reparations without either a balanced budget or a favorable balance of trade…The
                        only things wrong with the system were (a) that it would collapse as soon as the
                        United States ceased to lend, and (b) in the meantime debts were merely being
                        shifted from one account to another and no one was really getting any nearer to
                        solvency. In the period 1924 – 1931, Germany paid 10.5 billion marks in
                        reparations but borrowed abroad a total of 18.6 billion marks. Nothing was
                        settled by all this, but the international bankers sat in heaven, under a rain

                        requirements both for notes and deposits were cut in June 1917; a new system of

                        had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong, the first governor of the Federal
                        Reserve Bank of
                        New York
                        .
                        Strong owed his career to the favor of the Morgan Bank, especially of Henry P.
                        Davison, who made him secretary of the Bankers Trust Company of New York…in
                        1904, used him as Morgan’s agent in the banking rearrangements following the
                        crash of 1907, and made him vice-president of the Bankers Trust…in 1909. He
                        became governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of
                        New York
                        as the joint nominee of Morgan and
                        of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company in 1914. Two years later, Strong met
                        Norman
                        …and they at once
                        made an agreement to work in cooperation for the financial practices they both
                        revered.” **<strong>Paragraph 5</strong>: “It must not
                        be felt that these heads of the world’s chief central banks were themselves
                        substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the
                        technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own
                        countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them
                        down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of the
                        investment bankers…who remained largely behind the scenes in their own
                        unincorporated private banks. These formed a system of international cooperation
                        and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret
                        than that of their agents in the central banks. This dominance of investment
                        bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and investment funds
                        in their own countries and throughout the world. They could dominate the
                        financial and industrial systems of their own countries…; they could dominate
                        governments by their control over current government loans and the play of the
                        international exchange rates…In this system Rothschilds had been preeminent
                        during much of the nineteenth century, but , at the end of that century, they
                        were being replaced by J.P. Morgan whose central office was in New York,
                        although it was always operated as if it were in London (where it had, indeed,
                        originate as George Peabody and Company in 1838.)”
                        <strong>Note to self</strong>: The name “Morgan” began as “Peabody” and Rothschild
                        may have used Peabody/Morgan as a front man. In
                        <em>The Secrets of the Federal Reserve</em>, Eustace Mullins writes on page
                        49: “Soon after he arrived in
                        London
                        ,
                        George Peabody was surprised to be summoned to an audience with the gruff Baron
                        Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Without mincing words, Rothschild revealed to Peabody
                        , that much of the
                        London
                        aristocracy openly disliked Rothschild
                        and refused his invitations. He proposed that Peabody, a man of modest means, be
                        established as a lavish host whose entertainments would soon be the talk of
                        London
                        . Rothschild would,
                        of course, pay all the bills. Peabody accepted
                        the offer, and soon became known as the most popular host in
                        London
                        . It’s hardly surprising that the most
                        popular host in
                        London
                        would also become a very successful businessman, particularly with the House of
                        Rothschild supporting him behind the scenes.”

                        financiers, businessmen, and politicians tried to pretend to themselves and to
                        the public that they had restored the financial system of 1914. They had created
                        a façade of cardboard and tinsel which had a vague resemblance to the old
                        system, and they hoped that, if they pretended vigorously enough, they could
                        change this façade into the lost reality for which they yearned.” ***<strong>Paragraph</strong>
                        3: Unlike industrial capitalists, financiers weren’t interested in producing
                        goods and selling them for profit. Instead, they preferred to sell stocks and
                        bonds. This way, they could make money regardless of how well the underlying
                        business was doing. (If the business was strong, they earned fees selling its
                        securities (stocks / bonds) and if it was destroyed, they still earned fees.<span>&nbsp;

                        capitalism “…built railroads in order to sell securities, not in order to
                        transport goods; it constructed great steel corporations to sell securities, not
                        in order to make steel…the organization of financial capitalism had evolved to a
                        highly sophisticated level of security promotion and speculation which did not
                        require any productive investment as a basis. Corporations were built upon
                        corporations in the form of holding companies, so that securities were issued in
                        huge quantities, bringing profitable fees and commissions to financial
                        capitalists without any increase in economic production whatever.”<span>&nbsp;

                        issuing of such securities, they could also make killings out of the bankruptcy
                        of such corporations, through the fees and commissions of reorganization. A very
                        pleasant cycle of flotation, bankruptcy, flotation, bankruptcy began to be
                        practiced by these financial capitalists. The more excessive the flotation, the
                        greater the profits, and the more imminent the bankruptcy. The more frequent the
                        bankruptcy, the greater the profits of reorganization and the sooner the
                        opportunity of another excessive flotation with its accompanying profits.”

                        2, Financial capitalists seek to strengthen their control: “The growth of
                        financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control
                        and a use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect
                        injury of all other economic groups.” However, to strengthen their control
                        further, they began molding modern corporate law and practice to suit their
                        interests. <strong>Paragraph</strong> 4: First, they
                        wanted to attract as many corporate investors as possible. Second, they wanted
                        those investors to have as little control as possible. The first was achieved
                        “…by stock splitting, issuing securities of low par value, and by high-pressure
                        security salesmanship.” The second was achieved “…by plural-voting stock,
                        nonvoting stock, pyramiding of holding companies, election of directors by
                        cooptation, and similar techniques. The result of this was that larger and
                        larger aggregates of wealth fell into the control of smaller and smaller groups
                        of men.”

                        2: “While financial capitalism was thus weaving the intricate pattern of modern
                        corporation law and practice on one side, it was establishing monopolies and
                        cartels on the other. Both helped to dig the grave of financial capitalism and
                        pass the reins of economic control on to the newer monopoly capitalism.”<span>&nbsp;

                        the death of financial capitalism…I think he drastically underestimates the
                        power of creating debt-based money out of thin air, controlling the
                        <em>price</em>, quantity and flow of money, and
                        having sufficient <em>influence</em> to demand
                        multi-trillion dollar bailouts from government. This power, from what I’ve seen,
                        is only held by the heirs of his “financial capitalists.”

                        brought to commercial and financial activity. Since these controls had been

                        coercive power. The remedy, they felt, was to destroy the state….The simplest
                        way to destroy the state, they felt, would be to assassinate the chief of the

                            goodness of individuals for the continuance of social life. Rather it aimed to

                        At the same time, paper money was printed so freely…that prices rose rapidly and

                        over ten workers were nationalized (1920). This system of extreme Communism was
                        far from being a success, and peasant opposition steadily increased in spite of
                        the severe punishments inflicted for violations…This culminated in peasant
                        uprisings, urban riots, and a mutiny of the sailors at Kronstadt…Within a week a
                        turning point was passed; the whole system of “War Communism” and of peasant
                        requisitioning was abandoned in favor of a “New Economic Policy” of free

                        these tactics, there was a dramatic increase in economic prosperity and in

                        remodeled the political parties almost completely into economic and social
                        pressure groups which he played off, one against another. The chief of these
                        forces were the landlords (Conservative Party), the industrialists (National
                        Liberal Party), the Catholics (Center Party), and the workers (Social Democratic

                        personal command, arrested the SA leaders in the middle of the night and shot
                        most of them at once. In
                        Berlin
                        ,
                        Goring did the same to the SA leaders there. Both Hitler and Goring also killed
                        most of their personal enemies... In all, several thousands were eliminated in
                        this ‘blood purge.’”

                        the offices of president and chancellor, Hitler obtained the president’s legal
                        right to rule by decree, and obtained as well the supreme command of the
                        army…From this time on, in the minds of the Reichswehr and the bureaucracy, it

                        outside of the bureaucracy, of a party organization which countermanded and
                        evaded the decisions and actions of the regular bureaucracy. The regular police

                        (creation of new enterprises in the same activity); (e) for labor. All these

                        as chambers of commerce or agriculture. The employers’ associations sought to

                        business remained self-financing to a greater extent than those of other

                        understanding of the current debt-money system. As it stands, bankers “create”
                        every single dollar that exists. They then “loan” those created dollars into the
                        economy, earning interest on the entire money supply.<span>&nbsp;

                        the flow of money to favored interests (corporate / government / non-profit
                        organizations), manipulate interest rates and economic activity…seems to me that
                        the “financial capitalists” are still at the top of the financial food chain.

                            different from the United States, where the absence of any legal regulation of

                            and output quotas for all important industrial products. An example of this –
                            not by any means the worst – could be found in the German coal industry in 1937.
                            There were 260 mining companies. Of the total output, 21 companies had 90
                            percent, 5 had 50 percent, and 1 had 14 percent. These mines were organized into

                        exist with concentration as complete as this, but in addition the steel industry
                        was organized into a series of steel cartels (one for each product). These
                        cartels…had control of 100 percent of the German output of ferrous metal

                            to the period of commercial capitalism which preceded the Industrial Revolution.
                            These roots grew rapidly in the last half of the eighteenth century and were
                            well established with the founding of the Bank of France in 1800. At that date,
                            financial power was in the hands of about ten or fifteen private banking
                            houses... These bankers, all Protestant, were deeply involved in the agitations
                            leading up to the French Revolution. When the revolutionary violence got out of
                            hand, they were the chief forces behind the rise of Napoleon, whom they regarded
                            as the restorer of order. As a reward for this support, Napoleon in 1800 gave
                            these bankers a monopoly over French financial life by giving them control of
                            the new Bank of France. By 1811 most of these bankers had gone over to the
                            opposition to Napoleon because they objected to his continuation of a warlike
                            policy…As a result, this group shifted its allegiance from Bonaparte to Bourbon,
                            and survived the change in regime in 1815. This established a pattern of
                            political agility which was repeated with varying success in subsequent changes

                        life of the country. It was the advent of the railroad in the period 1830 – 1870
                        which changed this situation. The railroads required capital far beyond the
                        ability of any private banker to supply from his own resources. The difficulty

                        fitting. Thus the private banker became a manager of other persons’ funds rather

                        controlled millions, and he did it unobtrusively, no longer in the open in his
                        own name, but…concealed from public view by the plethora of financial and credit

                        operations for the system was in the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas, which was
                        managed, until 1937, by Horace Finaly of a Hungarian-Jewish family brought to
                        France
                        by Rothschild in 1880. From this bank was ruled much of the section of the
                        French economy controlled by this block. Included in this section were many
                        foreign and colonial enterprises, utilities, ocean shipping, airlines,

                            It could, and did, suppress or spread both news and advertising…it received

                        the supply of unsold goods through lowering the supply of goods to the level of
                        the supply of purchasing power. It is not generally realized that this method is
                        one of the chief ways in which the gap is closed in a normal business cycle. In
                        such a cycle, goods are destroyed by the simple expedient of not producing the
                        goods which the system is capable of producing.” In 1930 – 1934, failing to
                        match 1929 output levels “…represented a loss of goods worth $100 billion in the
                        United States, Britain, and Germany alone. This loss was
                        equivalent to the destruction of such goods.” (<strong>Note to self</strong>: I disagree…it
                        would be
                        more costly to

                        and vegetables. When a farmer leaves his crop of oranges, peaches, or

                        expense of harvesting, he is destroying the goods. Outright destruction of goods
                        already produced is not common, and occurred for the first time as a method of
                        combating depression in the years 1930 – 1934. During this period, stores of
                        coffee, sugar, and bananas were destroyed, corn was plowed under, and young
                        livestock was slaughtered to reduce the supply on the market.”

                        3: “Public spending as a method of counteracting depression can vary very
                        greatly in character, depending on the purposes of the spending. Spending for
                        destruction of goods or for restriction of output, as under the early New Deal
                        agricultural program, cannot be justified easily in a democratic country with
                        freedom of communications, because it obviously results in a decline in national
                        income and living standards. Spending for nonproductive monuments is somewhat
                        easier to justify but is hardly a long-run solution. Spending for investment in
                        productive equipment is obviously the best solution, since it leads to an
                        increase in national wealth and standards of living and is a long-run solution…”
                        (<strong>Note to self</strong>: What about when it
                        distorts the pricing and productive structure in the economy? What happens when
                        it creates unsustainable jobs and too much “product” for existing demand? Do we
                        then destroy the excess goods, or just lay the people off and stop producing? If
                        the latter, what about all of the industries that have grown up around the
                        artificially created demand? Why even entertain the idea of a
                        “government-managed economy” when, in the end, it always leads to excess waste
                        regardless of which way it is being “managed”? It seems the only people who
                        truly profit from this approach are politically and financially well-connected
                        special interests. They cash in while citizens pick up the tab.)

                        method for filling the deflationary gap and overcoming depression because it
                        adds purchasing power to the market without drawing it out again later (since
                        the armaments, once produced, are not put up for sale.) From an economic point
                        of view, this method of combating depression is not much different
                        from…destruction of goods, for, in this case also, economic resources are
                        diverted from constructive activities or idleness to production for

                        keep the peace (after it absorbed Europe) because it would be squeezed between
                        the Atlantic bloc and the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union could be forced

                        “The Social Democrats in control of the city and state of
                        Vienna
                        embarked upon an amazing program of
                        social welfare. The old monarchical system of indirect taxes was replaced by a
                        system of direct taxes which bore heavily on the well-to-do. With an honest,
                        efficient administration and a balanced budget, the living conditions of the
                        poor were transformed.”

                        only about $1,650 each…the average rent was less than $2.00 per month. Thus the
                        poor of Vienna spend only a fraction of their
                        income for rent, less than 3 percent, compared to the 25 percent in Berlin

                        4, Hitler shifts gears and decides to attack Czechoslovakia: “This draft was
                        entirely rewritten by Hitler and signed on May 30, 1938. Its opening sentence
                        then read, ‘It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by military action in
                        the near future.’ It then went on to say that in case of war with Czechoslovakia, whether France
                        intervened or not, all forces
                        would be concentrated on the Czechs in order to achieve an impressive success in
                        the first three days. The general strategic plan based on this order provided
                        that forces would be transferred to the French frontier only after a ‘decisive’
                        blow against Czechoslovakia
                        .

                        were to be withdrawn from
                        East Prussia
                        in order to speed up the defeat of the Czechs.”

                        his desire by

                        more. In November 1938 the Germans engaged in several days of sustained
                        atrocities against the Jews, destroying their property, razing their temples,
                        assaulting their persons, and concluded by imposing on the Jews of Germany a

                        in Britain and warning Hitler not to use force against Poland. The first British
                        suggestion was that the Soviet Union should give unilateral guarantees to
                        Poland and Romania similar to
                        those given by Britain

                        Britain
                        would do little or nothing or even give aid to Germany. That this last possibility
                        was not completely beyond reality is clear from the fact that Britain did prepare an
                        expeditionary
                        force to
                        attack Russia in March 1940,

                        incidents to justify his approaching attack. Political prisoners were taken from
                        concentration camps, dressed in German uniforms, and killed on the Polish
                        frontier as ‘evidence’ of Polish aggression.”

                        seen from the fact that deaths of civilians exceeded deaths of combatants and
                        that many of both were killed without any military justification, as victims of
                        sheer sadism and brutality, largely through cold-blooded savagery by Germans,
                        and, to a lesser extent, by Japanese and Russians, although British and American
                        attacks from the air on civilian populations and on non-military targets
                        contributed to the total. The distinctions between civilians and military
                        personnel and between neutrals and combatants, which had been blurred in the
                        First World War, were almost completely lost in the second. This is clear from a
                        few figures. The number of civilians killed reached 17 million, of which 5.4
                        million were Polish; while Poland
                        had less than 100,000
                        soldiers killed or missing in the Battle of Poland in 1939, Polish civilians to
                        the number of 3.9 million were executed, or murdered in the ghetto,

                        course of action for the United States to take in regards to the Japanese
                        Empire…suggesting the United States provoke Japan into committing an ‘overt act
                        of war’. The memo illustrates several people in the Office of Naval intelligence
                        promoted the idea of goading Japan into war: ‘It is not believed that in the
                        present state of political opinion the United States government is capable of
                        declaring war against Japan without more ado…If by [the elucidated eight-point

                        the suggestion, but the Russian armies stopped their advance and obstructed
                        supplies to the rebels, in spite of appeals from all parts of the world. On

                        leader saw that defeat was imminent. Yet the Nazi hierarchy and its jackal

                        increased the violence of their insane frenzies. This violence was turned

                            said: ‘I think it is well for the man in the street to realize that there is no
                            power on earth that can protect him from being bombed. Whatever people may tell
                            him, the bomber will always get through…When the next war comes, and European

                            in the years prior to the war. That is: if “acceptance of Douhetism by civilian
                            leaders in France and England was one of the chief factors in appeasement” it
                            makes perfect sense why the Network (seeking appeasement) promoted and
                            legitimized them. (By terrorizing citizens with stories of overwhelming German
                            air power, appeasement was easier to sell.)

                        and the universities which still exists. In that first year it spent only 6.5
                        million, but in the six years 1940 – 1946 it spent almost $454 million…In May
                        1941 a higher and wider organization was created, the Office of Scientific
                        Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as chairman and Conant as his
                        deputy…These groups were the supreme influence in America in introducing
                        rationalization and science into government and war in 1940 – 1946, fostering
                        hundreds of new technical developments and inventions, including the atom bomb.
                        One of their earliest acts was to make a census of research facilities and a

                        they did not hesitate to call upon the services of both as needed. When money
                        ran short, they found it from private sources, as in June 1941, when, simply by
                        asking, they obtained half a million dollars from MIT and an equal sum from John

                        project as a whole. Consequently, the vast majority of those working on the
                        project were not allowed to know what they were really doing or why, and this
                        lack of perspective greatly delayed the solution of problems. The whole project
                        of about 150,000 persons were segregated from their fellow citizens; all
                        communications were cut off or censored; and the project was overrun with guards

                        telephones, record conversations, and isolate individuals. These activities
                        significantly delayed American achievement of the atom bomb without achieving
                        their ostensible purpose, since there is no evidence either that the three enemy
                        Powers could have made the bomb or that Russia’s making of the bomb was

                        wanted it to be used to justify the $2 billion they had spent. A large group
                        sided with him because the Democratic leaders in Congress had authorized these
                        expenditures outside proper congressional procedures and had cooperated in
                        keeping them from almost all members of both houses by concealing them under
                        misleading appropriation headings. Majority Leader John W. McCormack (later
                        Speaker) once told me, half joking, that if the bomb had not worked he expected
                        to face penal charges….Jack Madigan said: ‘If the project succeeds, there won’t
                        be any investigation. If it doesn’t, they won’t investigate anything else.’
                        Moreover, some air-force officers were eager to protect the relative position of
                        their service in the postwar demobilization and drastic reduction of financial
                        appropriations by using a successful A-bomb drop as an argument that
                        Japan
                        had been defeated by air power rather than by naval or ground forces.”

                            losses are obvious but there are others, equally significant but not yet widely
                            recognized. The growth of international law in the late medieval and Renaissance
                            periods not only sought to make the distinctions we have indicated, as a
                            reaction against ‘feudal disorder’; it also sought to make a sharp distinction
                            between public and private authority (in order to get rid of the feudal doctrine
                            of dominia) and to set up sharp criteria of public authority involving the new
                            doctrine of sovereignty. One of the chief criteria of such sovereignty was
                            ability to maintain the peace and to enforce both law and order over a definite
                            territory; one of its greatest achievements was the elimination of arbitrary
                            nonsovereign private powers such as robber barons on land or piracy on the sea.
                            Under this conception, ability to maintain law and order became the chief
                            evidence of sovereignty, and the possession of sovereignty became the sole mark
                            of public authority and the existence of a state. All this has now been
                            destroyed. The Stimson Doctrine of 1931…shifted recognition from the objective
                            criterion of ability to maintain order to the subjective criterion of approval
                            of the new form of government or liking of a government’s domestic behavior.”

                        Bulgaria
                        by native Communists returning from Russia under protection of the

                        administration of Germany

                        Communist ideology in eastern and central Europe, especially among the peasants,
                        and that the buffer of Communist states along Russia’s western border would have
                        to be built on force and not on consent. The governments of these states could
                        be recruited from men of the respective nations who had been living in the
                        Soviet Union for years under endless Communist indoctrination, but the
                        unindoctrinated masses in each country would have to be held in bondage by
                        Soviet military forces, at least until local Communist parties and local
                        secret-police organizations subservient to Moscow’s orders could be built up.
                        The urgent need for this, from the Kremlin’s point of view, was shown, when Austria and Hungary,
                        although under Soviet
                        military occupation, were permitted relatively free elections in November of

                        center for Communist decisions throughout the world. In
                        Yugoslavia, where Tito was originally as anti-Western as

                        of 1947, when Tito tried to build up a non-Russian Communist bloc by signing
                        friendship treaties with Bulgaria,
                        Hungary, and Romania.

                        socialism to the world. Whereas Communists wanted to establish socialism quickly
                        through violence and revolution, the Fabians preferred to do it slowly through
                        propaganda and legislation. The word socialism was not to be used. Instead, they
                        would speak of benefits for the people such as welfare, medical care, higher
                        wages, and better working conditions. In this way, they planned to accomplish
                        their objective without bloodshed and even without serious opposition. They
                        scorned the Communists, not because they dislike their goals, but because they
                        disagreed with their methods. To emphasize the importance of gradualism, they
                        adopted the turtle as the symbol of their movement.”

                        publication opportunities, could favor persons who accepted the established

                        advance or hamper any specialist’s career. It is also true that these things
                        were done in the United States in regard to the Far East by the Institute of
                        Pacific Relations, that this organization had been infiltrated by Communists,
                        and by Communist sympathizers, and that much of this group’s influence arose
                        from its access to and control over the flow of funds from financial foundations
                        to scholarly activities. All these things were true, but they would have been
                        true of any other areas of American scholarly research and academic

                        “radical Right” and “neo-isolationists” blinded him to the weakness of his own
                        argument. How can he admit that this group had a great deal of power, a specific
                        agenda, and actually achieved what it hoped for, but then dismiss it all as a
                        lucky break due to Chiang Kai-shek’s “incompetence?” I think the question of
                        what Washington decided to with China answers itself.

                        situation lies another, more profound, relationship, which influences matters
                        much broader than Far Eastern policy. It involves the organization of tax-exempt

                        educational, scientific, ‘and other public purposes.’ Sixty or more years ago,
                        public life in the West was dominated by the influence of ‘Wall Street.’ This

                        industrialism, but, on the contrary, refers to international financial
                        capitalism deeply involved in the gold standard, foreign-exchange fluctuations,
                        floating of fixed-interest securities and, to a lesser extent, flotation of
                        industrial shares for stock-exchange markets.”

                        Morgan and Company from the 1880’s to the 1930’s was cosmopolitan, Anglophile,
                        internationalist, Ivy League, eastern seaboard, high Episcopalian, and
                        European-culture conscious. Their connection with the Ivy League colleges rested
                        on the fact that the large endowments of these institutions required constant
                        consultations with the financiers of Wall Street…and was reflected in the fact
                        that these endowments, even in 1930, were largely in bonds rather than in real
                        estate or common stocks. As a consequence of these influences, as late as the
                        1930’s, J. P. Morgan and his associates were the most significant figures in
                        policy making at Harvard, Columbia, and to a lesser extent Yale, while the
                        Whitneys were significant at Yale, and the Prudential Insurance Company (through
                        Edward D. Duffield) dominated Princeton.”

                            dominant position in Wall Street, the Morgan firm came also to dominate other
                            Wall Street powers, such as Carnegie, Whitney, Vanderbilt, Brown-Harriman, or
                            Dillon-Reed. Close alliances were made with Rockefeller, Mellon, and Duke
                            interests but not nearly so intimate ones with the great industrial powers like
                            du Pont and Ford. In spite of the great influence of this ‘Wall Street’
                            alignment, an influence great enough to merit the name of the ‘American
                            Establishment,’ this group could not control the Federal government and, in
                            consequence, had to adjust to a good many government actions thoroughly
                            distasteful to the group. The chief of these were in taxation law, beginning
                            with the graduated income tax in 1913, but culminating above all else, in the
                            inheritance tax. These tax laws drove the great private fortunes dominated by
                            Wall Street into tax-exempt foundations which became a major link in the
                            Establishment network between Wall Street, the Ivy League, and the Federal
                            government.” (<strong>Note to self</strong>: So, were
                            they really against these laws, or were they secretly for them? Better question:
                            Why would they care about “tax laws” that didn’t weaken their position? …By
                            shuffling some papers around, they technically give up direct “ownership,” but
                            not control of, their vast fortunes. In this scenario, they haven’t lost a penny
                            of power or <em>influence</em>. At the same
                            time, the so-called income tax creates an enormous new revenue stream for them;
                            the Federal government collects “income taxes” from their competitors and US
                            citizens, and then spends those taxes by the billions into the coffers of their
                            politically-connected businesses. Also, let’s not forget that the Federal
                            Reserve System was created in 1913 too. The so-called “income tax” created a
                            stream of revenue to pay “interest” on the new “debt” that “The Establishment”
                            could create out of thin air, through the Federal Reserve System.)

                        the people. Wall Street supplied both. The purpose was not to destroy, dominate,
                        or take over but was really threefold: (1) to keep informed about the thinking
                        of Left-wing or liberal groups; (2) to provide them with a mouthpiece so that

                        explained the relationship in the ‘official’ biography of Willard Straight which
                        he wrote for a payment of $25,000. ‘Of course they [the Straights] could always

                        their disapproval.’ Croly’s biography of Straight, published in 1924, makes
                        perfectly clear that Straight was in no sense a liberal or a progressive, but
                        was, indeed, a typical international banker and that The New Republic was simply

                        required approval or recommendation from members of IPR. Moreover, access to
                        publication and recommendations to academic positions in the handful of great
                        American universities concerned with the Far East
                        required similar sponsorship. And, finally, there can be little doubt that
                        consultant jobs on Far Eastern matters in the State Department or other
                        government agencies were largely restricted to IPR-approved people. The
                        individuals who published, who had money, found jobs, were consulted, and who
                        were appointed intermittently to government missions were those who were
                        tolerant of the IPR line. The fact that all these lines of communication passed
                        through the Ivy League universities or their scattered equivalents west of the
                        Appalachians, such as Chicago, Stanford, or
                        California
                        ,
                        unquestionably went back to Morgan’s influence in handling large academic
                        endowments.”

                        permitted for two years, in the early 1960’s, to examine its papers and secret
                        records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of
                        my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both

                            matter to get rid of the Red sympathizers. Before this could be done, however, a

                        vacancies created by his periodic purges. These purges not only opened the way
                        upward for younger and more ruthless men, but served as justifications for
                        Stalin’s growing paranoia. Within the party, the purges of 1924 – 1929 had
                        eliminated, usually by death, most of the “Old Bolsheviks” (those who had been
                        party members before the 1917 Revolution). In 1929 – 1934, using a new and
                        younger group, Stalin had killed 10,000,000 Russians (his own estimate) in the
                        drive to establish collective farms. The second great purge of 1934 – 1939 had
                        killed off a large part of the Stalinists who had assisted Stalin’s rise to
                        power and about 5,000 officers of the armed forces. The third great purge, which
                        was shaping up at the end of 1952, was intended to eliminate the rest of the
                        Stalinists who had come to positions of power, in succession to the Old
                        Bolsheviks, in 1929 – 1935.”

                        Yugoslavia in May 1955. This acceptance of Titoism is of great importance
                        because it showed Russia
                        in an apologetic role for a major past error and because it reversed Stalin’s

                            are the exclusive concern of individual countries.’ Khrushchev and Tito both
                            knew that this statement was playing with fire…With his customary shrewdness
                            Khrushchev did not sign the Belgrade Declaration himself, but had Bulganin, the
                            new premier, do it, thus protecting himself from direct responsibility if

                            or records. In a speech of 30,000 words Khrushchev made a horrifying attack on
                            Stalin as a bloodthirsty and demented tyrant who had destroyed tens of thousands
                            of loyal party members on falsified evidence, or no evidence at all, merely to
                            satisfy his own insatiable thirst for power…The full nightmare of the Soviet
                            system was revealed, not as an attribute of the system (which it was), but as a
                            personal idiosyncrasy of Stalin himself; not as the chief feature of Communism
                            from 1917 (which it was) , but only as its chief feature since 1934; and nothing

                        atrocities fully at the time, often anticipated them, benefited personally from
                        them, and egged Stalin on to greater ones. In fact, even as Khrushchev in his
                        speech condemned Stalin’s acts which caused the deaths of thousands in the
                        party, he defended Stalin’s acts which caused the deaths of millions in the
                        country. The fault was not merely with Stalin; it was with the system; and, even
                        wider than that, it was with Russia
                        . Any system of human life
                        which is based on autocracy and authority, as Russian life has always been, will
                        turn up sadistic monsters…And the more completely total and irresponsible power
                        is concentrated in one man’s hands, the more frequently will a monster of sadism
                        be produced.”

                        toward neutralism was helped by Dulles’s refusal to accept the existence of
                        neutralism. His rebuffs tended to drive those areas which wanted to be neutral
                        into the arms of Russia
                        ,
                        because the new nations of the developing Buffer Fringe valued their
                        independence above all else. The Russian acceptance of neutralism may be dated
                        about 1954, while Dulles still felt strongly adverse to neutralism four or even
                        five years later. This gave the Soviet Union a
                        chronological advantage which served in some small degree to compensate for its
                        many disadvantages in the basic struggle to win the favor of the neutrals.”

                        help. Mao’s government was the first state to give Vietnam diplomatic recognition
                        (January 1950), and at once began to send military supplies and guidance to Ho

                        groups. Most of these…were exploitative of the Iranian peoples and were very
                        unpopular. Of these concessions the most significant was one granted in 1901 to

                        petroleum business in all Iran

                        achieved this by selling oil, below its real value, to companies that AIOC
                        owned. Royalty payments, owed to

                        incomprehensible to the Near East, and the
                        parliamentary system, where it existed, was only a façade for an autocratic

                        than on "such objective obstacles as limited natural resources" and this is
                        proven by the success of Israel. <strong>Note to
                            self: </strong>Really? How many billions in financial, technological, political and
                        military aid has Israel
                        received? This isn't even worth mentioning as a factor? Quigley writes: "…the
                        Zionist movement has constructed the strongest, most stable, most progressive,
                        most democratic, and most hopeful state in the Near East.
                        This was possible because of the morale of the Israeli, which was based on
                        outlooks antithetical to the attitudes of the Arabs. The Israeli were full of
                        self-sacrifice, self-discipline, social solidarity, readiness to work,
                        cooperation, and hopes for the future. Their Ideology was largely Western, with
                        a devotion to science, democracy, Individual respect, technology, and the future
                        which could match or exceed the best periods of the Western past." At least, on

                        U.S. was able to pressure
                        Israel using "severe economic and financial threats of an
                        unofficial nature from
                        Washington
                        . The
                        effectiveness of such threats rested on the fact that the whole Israeli economy
                        was dependent on the flow of private funds from the United States…" </span>

                        by Hitler's determination to annihilate the Jews of Europe…The Jews, their

                        Europe. Since there was nowhere else they could go, many were smuggled into
                        Palestine
                        . British efforts
                        to prevent this, in fulfillment of their obligations to the Arabs under the
                        League of Nations Mandate, led to a kind of guerilla warfare between Jews and
                        British…This problem reached acute form when the conquest of Germany opened the doors for
                        surviving Jews to escape from the horrors of Nazism. In August 1945, President
                        Truman asked British permission to admit 100,000 European Jews into
                        Palestine
                        , but his repeated
                        requests were refused. Ignoring such permission, large-scale efforts were made
                        to smuggle Jewish refugees into
                        Palestine
                        , where they could be cared for by Jewish
                        groups. Many of these were transported under frightful conditions in
                        overcrowded, leaky ships, which were often intercepted by the British, who took
                        their passengers to concentration camps in
                        Cyprus.
                        From such actions came reprisals and counter-reprisals."

                        maintain law and public order among its inhabitants inside those boundaries. By
                        1946, as a consequence of the power stalemate of the Cold War, dozens of
                        'states' (such as the Congo) which could perform neither of these actions were
                        recognized as states by the Superpowers and their allies, and achieved this
                        recognition in international law by being admitted to the United Nations. This
                        development culminated over fifty years of destruction of the old establishment
                        distinctions of international law such as the distinctions between war and peace

                        despotism in connection with traditional China,
                        the old Ottoman Empire, and czarist Russia. It goes back to the archaic
                        Bronze Age empires, which first appeared in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus
                        Valley, and northern China before 1,000 B.C. Basically such an Asiatic despotism
                        is a two-class society in which a lower class, consisting of at least
                        nine-tenths of the population, supports an upper, ruling class consisting of
                        several interlocking groups. These ruling groups are a governing bureaucracy of
                        scribes and priests associated with army leaders, landlords, and moneylenders.
                        Such an upper class accumulated great quantities of wealth as taxes, rents,
                        interest on loans, fees for services, or simply as financial extortions. The
                        social consequences were either progressive or reactionary, depending on whether
                        this accumulated wealth in the possession of the ruling class was invested in
                        more productive utilization of resources or was simply hoarded and wasted. The
                        essential character of such an Asiatic despotism rests on the fact that the
                        ruling class has legal claims on the working masses, and possess the power (from
                        its control of arms and the political structure) to enforce these claims."</span>

                            generally, as probably a good thing, a source of pride to most citizens and
                            probably of some material advantage to the country as a whole. The costs of

                            postwar period and increased anticolonial agitations required heavy taxation and
                            compulsory military service to regain or to retain such colonial areas. Once
                            this was recognized, the former rather vague satisfaction with colonial

                        increasing offensive power of the Western weapons systems has made it possible
                        to compel obedience over wider and wider areas and over larger numbers of
                        peoples. Accordingly, political organizations (such as the state) have been able
                        to rule over larger areas, and thus have become larger in size and fewer in
                        numbers in our Western world. In this way, the political development of Europe
                        over the last millennium has seen thousands of
                        feudal areas coalesce into hundreds of principalities, and these into scores of
                        dynastic monarchies, and, finally, into a dozen or more national states. The
                        national state, its size measured in hundreds of miles, was based, to a
                        considerable extent, on the fact that the weapons system of the nineteenth

                            thousands (rather than hundreds) of miles and thus over distances greater than
                            those occupied by existing linguistic and cultural groups. It thus became
                            necessary to appeal for allegiance to the state on grounds wider than
                            nationalism. This gave rise, in the 1930’s and 1940’s, to the idea of
                            continental blocs and the ideological state (replacing the national state).

                            also changing, although few noticed this. The role of force in politics had been
                            effective to the degree that it was <strong>able
                                to influence the minds and wills of men</strong>. But the new weapons, in seeking
                            increased range, had become weapons of mass destruction rather than instruments
                            of persuasion. If the victims of such weapons are killed, they can neither obey
                            nor consent. Thus the new weapons have become instruments, not of political
                            power, but of destruction of all power organizations. This explains the growing
                            reluctance by all concerned to use them. Furthermore, their range and areas of
                            impact make them most ineffective against individual men and especially against
                            the minds of individual men. And, finally, in an ideological state
                            <strong>it is the minds of men that must be the
                                principal targets</strong>. Any organization is coordinated both by patterned
                            relationships and by ideology and morale. If the former become increasingly
                            threatened by weapons of destruction, the organization can survive by becoming
                            decentralized, with less emphasis on organizational relationships and more
                            emphasis on morale and outlook. They thus become increasingly amorphous and
                            invulnerable to modern weapons of destruction. The peoples of
                            Africa
                            are,, for this reason among others, not susceptible to compulsion by megaton
                            bombs. And Western peoples or Soviet peoples can become less susceptible by

                            in area or even became smaller. The growing power of castles in the period about

                        of political life in the two countries, each is increasingly reaching its most
                        fundamental decisions, not through party politics or by decision in a political

                        other by largely hidden contacts carried on behind the scenes. (2) These
                        pressures are chiefly concerned with the allotment of economic resources,
                        through fiscal and budgetary mechanisms, among three competing sectors of the

                        and capital investment. (3) Socially, both societies are undergoing a similar
                        circulation of elites in which education is the chief doorway to social
                        advancement and is crowded with applicants from the lower (but not lowest)
                        stratum of society (equivalent to the petty bourgeoisie or lower middle classes)

                        uppermost) group whose parents are already established in the prevalent
                        structure. (4) In both countries trained experts and technicians, as a
                        consequence of this educational process, are replacing political figures or
                        other social groups, especially political specialists. In both, the military
                        leaders, although qualified for supreme influence by their possession of power,
                        are held at secondary levels by personal manipulations. (5) In both countries
                        there is a growing intellectual skepticism toward authority, accepted
                        ideologies, and established slogans, replaced by a rising emphasis upon the need

                        the most significant example of a successful federalist structure in modern
                        history, the federalist principle has yielded ground to the unitary government
                        for 150 years or so. Moreover, in our own time a number of efforts, chiefly
                        British, to set up federal unions have failed. Thus the Central African
                        Federation of the Rhodesias
                        and Nyasaland broke up after a few years, and the West

                            to a narrower or wider structure. This tendency seems likely to arise from a
                            number of influences of which the chief might be: (1) the inability of many of
                            the new, small states to carry on all the functions of government independently
                            and alone, and their consequent efforts to carry out some of them cooperatively;
                            (2) the tendency for these new states to look to the United Nations to perform
                            some of the most significant functions of government, such as defense of
                            frontiers or maintaining public order…(3) the need for economic cooperation over
                            wider areas than the boundaries of most states in order to obtain the necessary
                            diversity of resources within a single economic system, a need that will
                            continue to encourage the establishment of customs unions and economic blocs, of
                            which the European Common Market is the outstanding example; similar unions are

                            became the solution of all problems, whether it was the question of winning a

                            nineteenth-century liberalism was simply a temporary organizational
                            manifestation of what has always been the underlying Western outlook. That
                            organizational manifestation is now largely dead, killed as much by
                            twentieth-century liberals as by conservatives or reactionaries. It was killed
                            because liberals took applications of that manifestation of the Western outlook
                            and made these applications rigid, ultimate, and inflexible goals.
                            <strong>The liberal of 1880 was anticlerical,
                                antimilitarist, and antistate because these were, to his immediate experience,
                                authoritarian forces that sought to prevent the operation of the Western way</strong>.
                            The same liberal was for freedom of assembly, of speech, and of the press
                            because these were necessary to form the consensus that is so much a part of the

                            in themselves. The liberal was prepared to force people to associate with those
                            they could not bear, in the name of freedom of assembly, or he was, in the name
                            of freedom of speech, prepared to force people to listen. His anticlericalism
                            became an effort to prevent people from getting religion, and his antimilitarism
                            took the form of opposing funds for legitimate defense. Most amazing, his
                            earlier opposition to the use of private economic power to restrict individual
                            freedoms took the form of an effort to increase the authority of the state
                            against private economic power and wealth in themselves.
                            <strong>Thus the liberal of 1880 and the liberal
                                of 1940 had reversed themselves on the role and power of the state, the earlier
                                seeking to curtail it, the latter seeking to increase it. </strong>In the process,
                            the upholder of the former liberal idea that the power of the state should be
                            curtailed came to be called a conservative.” (Emphasis added)

                        that tradition is a liberal tradition, the two should be closely allied in their
                        aim at common goals. So long as liberals and conservatives have as their primary
                        goals to defend interests and to belabor each other for partisan reasons, they
                        cannot do this.”

                        importance or priority: military service, preparation for a vocation, love and

                        domineering parents’ ambitions or a conformist or a self-centered careerist who
                        has shrewdly calculated his teachers’ prejudices and expectations and discovered
                        how to regurgitate efficiently what they want. Or he may have focused narrowly
                        on grade-getting as compensation for his inadequacies in other areas, because he
                        lacks other interests or talents or lacks passion and warmth or normal healthy
                        instincts or is afraid of life. The top high school student is often, frankly, a
                        pretty dull and bloodless, or peculiar fellow. The adolescent with wide-ranging
                        curiosity and stubborn independence, with a vivid imagination and a desire to
                        explore fascinating bypaths, to follow his own interests, to contemplate, to
                        read the unrequired books, the boy filled with sheer love of life and
                        exuberance, may well seem to his teachers troublesome, undisciplined, a rebel,
                        may not conform to the stereotype, and may not get the top grades and the
                        highest rank in class. He may not even score at the highest level in the
                        standard multiple choice admission tests, which may well reward the glib, facile
                        mind at the expense of the questioning, independent, or slower but more

                        acquired from Lady Milner), and was close to the Establishment from his father’s
                        long-time associations with the Milner Group, the
                        <em>Times</em>, the Round Table, and his intimate friendship with Lord Brand;
                        the son shocked the Court by his open criticism of the Queen’s social
                        associations as undemocratic; and his weekly articles for the Guardian advocated
                        among other things, abolition of the hereditary House of Lords; or (2) Goronwy
                        Rees of New College and All Souls who had denounced the English amateur
                        tradition in government and business as a ‘cult of incompetence,’ and demanded,
                        to replace it, a system of training and recruitment that will provide a British
                        managerial class marked by professional competence rather than by what he
                        regards as ‘frivolity’; or (3) John Vaizey, one-time Scholar of Queens College,
                        Cambridge and now Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, who denounces the whole
                        English educational system as inadequate and misguided and would replace it with
                        something more like the French openly competitive system of free education.”

                    <p><strong>1311</strong>, paragraph
                        1: “The hope of the twentieth century rests on its recognition that war and
                        depression are man-made, and needless. They can be avoided in the future by
                        turning…back to other characteristics that our Western society has always
                        regarded as virtues: generosity, compassion, cooperation, rationality, and
                        foresight and finding an increased role in human life for love, spirituality,
                        charity, and self-discipline. We now know fairly well how to control the
                        increase in population, how to produce wealth and reduce poverty or disease; we
                        may, in the near future, know how to postpone senility and death; it certainly
                        should be clear to those who have their eyes open that violence, extermination,
                        and despotism do not solve problems for anyone and that victory and conquest are
                        delusions as long as they are merely physical and materialistic.”
