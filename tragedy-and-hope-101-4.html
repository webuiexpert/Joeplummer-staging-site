                        <p>"Antiquity presents everywhere…the spectacle of a few men molding mankind according to their
                            whims, thanks to the prestige of force and fraud."</p>

                    <p>Hopefully by now we've established the fact that a small, powerful, and secretive group can alter
                        the course of world history. Additionally, we've established that this form of coercive power
                        (hidden, dishonest, and dangerous) is nothing new. It existed thousands of years ago, it existed
                        hundreds of years ago, and it exists today. Only the names, sophistication, and reach of the
                        "instruments" have changed. Since this form of power is inherently illegitimate, we need no
                        further justification to free ourselves from it.</p>

                    <p>As noted, a handful of individuals have played such an important role in the creation of our
                        current system that their names must be mentioned. However, targeting individuals within the
                        system isn't going to solve our problems. Even if only one out of one thousand people are
                        genius-level sociopaths (the percentage is probably <em>much</em> higher), that equals seven
                        million potential recruits for the Network to draw from. In other words, there will always be an
                        inexhaustible pool of replacements available to fill the tiny number of key policy-making posts
                        within the system. For this reason, the predatory system <em>itself</em> must be destroyed.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately for us, there is a vital target for us to strike; one foundational element that the
                        entire system is built on and cannot stand without: the Network's control of money.
                        <em>This</em> is their primary weapon, and it is well within our power to take it from them.</p>

                    <p>The vast majority of people—people like you and me—don't think of money as a weapon. For us, it's
                        simply something that we earn and then use to purchase products and services. The Network, on
                        the other hand, has a much, <em>much</em> deeper understanding of what money is and how to wield
                        its power. For them, money isn't about acquiring more material goods or services; it's about
                        acquiring more <em>control</em> over the resources and instruments that govern human behavior.
                        When viewed in this light, their seemingly insatiable desire to accumulate and control money
                        makes more sense.</p>

                    <p>Keep in mind, this doesn't mean that personal ownership of money is the Network's most effective
                        monetary weapon. In fact, we could take away the personal fortunes of all of its members and, if
                        that's all we did, their power would remain undisturbed, and they would rebuild their fortunes
                        in no time. This is because the Network knows something that most of us do not: <em>control</em>
                        of money, not actual "ownership," is what truly matters. Where you and I cannot imagine having
                        the ability to control money that doesn't belong to us, the Network cannot imagine having it any
                        other way.</p>

                    <p>In this chapter, we'll cover the three primary mechanisms that the Network uses to perpetuate its
                        monetary power. These mechanisms are: (1) the ability to combine and control the earnings of
                        others, (2) the ability to directly confiscate the earnings of others, and (3) the ability to
                        create money out of thin air.</p>

                    <h2>1: Combine and Control Money</h2>

                    <p>Beginning on pages 50–51 of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, Quigley speaks of a group that employs
                        "financial capitalism" to monopolize business and control government. As experts in "financial
                        manipulation," these men "aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers" and,
                        according to Quigley, they succeeded at a level that rivaled the political dynasties of past
                        centuries. Centered in London, with offshoots in New York and Paris, the power of this group is
                        described as overwhelming in significance and "occult" in nature. By 1850<a href="#fn2"
                            id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a> they could access the immense monetary power of "the
                        Stock Exchange, the Bank of England, and the London money market." But this was just the
                        beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In time, they brought into their financial network…commercial banks and savings banks, as
                            well as insurance companies, to form all of these into a single financial system on an
                            international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Just to clarify: these men did not <em>own</em> the money that citizens placed in commercial and
                        savings banks. They did not <em>own</em> the money that citizens paid into retirement funds,
                        insurance funds, or trust funds. However, as already mentioned, they didn't need to own the
                        money. All they needed was the power to <em>control</em> it, and <em>that</em> they had. As long
                        as an institution within their "financial network" held the funds, they could direct those funds
                        toward increasing their power. They, alone, determined how and where that enormous,
                        international pool of money would be invested.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Bankers, especially…international investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and
                            government. They could dominate business…because investment bankers had the ability to
                            supply, or refuse to supply, capital…they took seats on the boards of directors of
                            industrial firms, as they had already done on commercial banks, saving banks, insurance
                            firms and finance companies….<strong>they funneled capital to enterprises which yielded
                                control, and away from those who resisted.</strong><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"
                                class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p><strong>Side Note</strong>: Quigley points out that bankers have far less power over those who
                        can finance their own operations.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a> As such,
                        any group seeking to create a ruling "dynasty of international bankers" would be wise to create
                        a system that is built on debt and undermines independent financing. Anything that devours or
                        wipes out the wealth of outsiders will create endless opportunities for members of the dynasty
                        who have an <em>inexhaustible</em><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a> supply of
                        money to loan (always with strings attached):</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The power of investment bankers over governments rests on a number of factors, of which the
                            most significant, perhaps, is the need of governments to borrow money. Just as businessmen
                            go to commercial banks for current capital advances…so a government has to go to merchant
                            bankers (or institutions controlled by them) to tide over the shallow places caused by
                            irregular tax receipts. As experts in government bonds, the international bankers not only
                            handled the necessary advances but provided advice to government officials and, on many
                            occasions, placed their own members in official posts…</p>

                        <p>In addition to their power over government based on government financing and personal
                            influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them to go by other
                            pressures. Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice from
                            bankers whom they considered to be experts in the field. <strong>The history of the last
                                century shows…that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice they gave
                                to industrialists, was consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous for
                                governments, businessmen, and the people generally</strong>. Such advice could be
                            enforced if necessary by manipulation of exchanges, gold flows, discount rates, and even
                            levels of business activity.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>To summarize: using enormous amounts of other people's money, international bankers essentially
                        purchased their way into powerful business and government positions. With each new position,
                        they gained control of more money. With control of more money, they gained access to more
                        positions (so on and so forth). Through this process they secured enough monetary power to
                        <em>enforce</em> their "advice" on both businesses and governments alike, expanding the reach of
                        their hidden dynasties each step of the way.</p>

                    <p>This now brings us to the Network's two crowning achievements of 1913: the federal income tax and
                        the Federal Reserve System.</p>

                    <p>Using <em>government</em> as its instrument, the Network granted itself the legal authority to
                        both create and directly confiscate the money it needs to finance its global objectives. The
                        enormity of this topic, especially regarding the legal right to <em>create</em> money, requires
                        hundreds of pages to cover properly. This chapter will provide only a short introduction. To
                        fully understand the power derived from creating money, I highly recommend further research into
                        the Federal Reserve System.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a> For now, let's
                        start with the easier of the two funding mechanisms: not money <em>creation</em>, but money
                        <em>confiscation</em>.</p>

                    <h2>2: Confiscate Money</h2>

                    <p>On page 938 of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, Quigley draws a flawed conclusion. He assumes that J.
                        P. Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc., must have <em>lacked</em> control over the government in
                        1913. If they had more power, he suggests, they would have stopped the federal income tax from
                        becoming law. Like so many others who've accepted the alleged purpose of the income tax, Quigley
                        fails to put two and two together: an income tax that is paid into a system <em>that the Network
                            controls</em> only serves to strengthen the Network's position. It creates another massive
                        flow of other people's money to tap into.</p>

                    <p>Even if high-ranking members like J. P. Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc., had paid the income
                        tax like everyone else, they'd still gain control over far more money than they paid in. (The
                        amount of money collected from the rest of the population <em>each year</em> ran into the
                        billions by 1917, then the tens of billions by the mid-1940s, then the hundreds of billions by
                        the mid-1970s, and it runs into the trillions today.)<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"
                            class="footnote">[8]</a> Remember, they don't have to <em>own</em> that money to determine
                        how it's spent.</p>

                    <p>Of course, these men did not pay income taxes like everyone else. Instead, they used the
                        government to establish "tax-exempt" foundations <em>before</em> the income tax became law. This
                        not only enabled them to shield their own fortunes, but it also enabled them to gain further
                        control over Ivy League education and the federal government itself. Remarkably, Quigley
                        acknowledges the ultimate effect of the income tax and the tax-exempt foundations, but he
                        doesn't seem to think about it much further:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>These tax laws drove the great private fortunes…into tax-exempt foundations which became a
                            major link in the Establishment network between Wall Street, the Ivy League, and the Federal
                            government.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>For insight into how the Network really felt about the income tax, we can simply turn our
                        attention back to E. M. House. In his book <em>Philip Dru: Administrator</em> (written
                        anonymously before the income-tax amendment was passed), House openly attacked the "grotesque"
                        American Constitution because it prevented "the government" from collecting an income tax from
                        its citizens.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a> Shortly after House's choice
                        for president (Woodrow Wilson) was placed in office, the "grotesque" constitutional barrier was
                        removed, and the money began to flow.</p>

                    <p>Sadly, few Americans realize that the United States did not have a permanent personal income tax
                        prior to 1913.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a> Think about that for a
                        minute…America went from being a sparsely settled nation of wilderness in 1776 to the most
                        prosperous and arguably most powerful nation on the planet <em>without</em> an income tax.
                        Contrary to the popular canard, a lack of income tax <em>does not</em> mean your country is
                        doomed (socially, politically, militarily, and economically) to the global status of Somalia.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here's another little-known fact about the income tax: if we abolished the personal income tax
                        today, the federal government would still collect about $3 billion <em>per day</em> ($125
                        million per hour) in revenue. Compare that to its revenue in 1913 of less than $1 billion
                        <em>per year</em>,<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a> and the obscenity of
                        what the Network has achieved becomes pretty clear. Even after adjusting for inflation, the
                        numbers are still alarming. (One billion dollars per year in 1913 would equal about $25 billion
                        per year today.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a> At the current rate of
                        federal spending, that inflation-adjusted $25 billion would be gone in a little over two
                        days!)<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote">[14]</a></p>

                    <p>All of this federal spending requires an ever-expanding river of money. Follow that river, and
                        you'll find that it inevitably empties into an ocean of Network-connected industries and
                        "interests." Even humanitarian "government" services like food stamps are handled by JP Morgan
                        and generate millions of dollars for the firm. Start looking into the military-industrial
                        complex, which serves the ultimate Network interest (its sovereignty-destruction project), and
                        the costs, financial and otherwise, boggle the mind. But as bad as all of this is, we've still
                        only scratched the surface.</p>

                    <p>Yes, the income tax essentially handed the Network a license to steal. Without its instrument
                        (government), there would be no way to directly confiscate trillions of dollars annually from
                        the labor of US citizens. The power of this funding mechanism, which did not exist for nearly
                        140 years of our nation's history, has strengthened the Network's global influence beyond
                        measure. However, even on its best day, the so-called income tax runs a distant second to the
                        greatest monetary power of all: the power to <em>create money</em> out of thin air.</p>

                    <h2>3: Create Money—Create Credit—Create Inescapable DEBT</h2>

                    <p>In the next chapter, we'll briefly cover the basic mechanics of creating money, credit, and
                        inescapable debt. For now, let's cover something that's arguably more important and
                        <em>definitely</em> easier to understand: the implications of possessing such incredible
                        monetary power and the story of how the Network seized it. First, the implications. We'll start
                        small and work our way up.</p>

                    <p>Can you imagine if the government gave you 100 million dollars? Think about that for a minute.
                        Tomorrow, at noon, the government has agreed to transfer $100 million into your bank account, no
                        strings attached…Got it? OK, let's go a little further.</p>

                    <p>Can you imagine if the government gave you 500 million dollars? How about $1 billion? Better yet,
                        what if it simply decided to give you $1 <em>trillion</em>? It's difficult to get your mind
                        around such large numbers, but really <em>try</em> to imagine what it would be like. For
                        instance, if the government gave you $1 trillion and if you invested it, earning only a 7
                        percent annual return, you'd wind up with over $5.5 billion per month in additional income
                        (roughly $192 million <em>per day</em>.)<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a>
                        Imagine having the ability to spend $192 million <em>per day</em> without ever depleting a penny
                        of the $1 trillion you were given. How much power would you have? And with so much money to
                        spend, how many individuals and institutions would want to be your friend?</p>

                    <p>Now, let's take it one step further…What if the government gave you <em>all</em> of the dollars?
                        What if you were given the exclusive right to create every single dollar that exists? Try to get
                        your head around <em>that</em> concept. (If a dollar exists anywhere in the world, it only
                        exists because <em>you</em> were given the right to create it.) <em>Now</em> how much power do
                        you have? The following quote provides a pretty good idea:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can, and do,
                            <strong>create money</strong>…And they who control the credit of the nation <strong>direct
                                the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the
                                people.</strong>"—Reginald McKenna, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, as quoted in
                            <em>Tragedy and Hope</em><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote">[16]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>That statement is about as straightforward as it gets, and it comes from a man who had intimate
                        knowledge of the topic. He worked at the highest levels within the system and is stating,
                        unequivocally, exactly how it <em>is</em>. Those who create money and control the credit of the
                        nation "direct the policy of governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of
                        the people." So why is it, if <em>creating money</em> and controlling credit confer so much
                        power, that so few people understand either of these topics? Shouldn't we all be taught the
                        dangers of such power? Is it any surprise that we aren't?</p>

                    <p>Again, Quigley provides some insight. He explains that, for the Network to achieve its
                        objectives, "it was necessary to <strong>conceal</strong>, or even to <strong>mislead</strong>,
                        both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of operation."<a
                            href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a> This practice of deceiving governments
                        and people about money continues to this day because it's the only way for the Network to
                        maintain its current level of power. Rest assured, if the vast majority of people do not
                        understand what central banks are or how they operate, it's because they were <em>not meant</em>
                        to. Our global monetary system was created by men who "conceal" and "mislead" as a matter of
                        course. It's not only how they conduct their business, it's how they intend to secure their
                        "far-reaching aim," reiterated below.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create
                            <strong>a world system of financial control…able to dominate the political system of each
                                country and the economy of the world as a whole.</strong> This system was to be
                            controlled…by the <strong>central banks</strong> of the world acting in secret
                            agreements…<strong>Each central bank</strong>, in the hands of men like Montagu Norman of
                            the Bank of England [and] Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve…<strong>sought to
                                dominate its government</strong> by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate
                            foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to
                            influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. In
                            each country <strong>the power of the central bank rested largely on its control of credit
                                and money supply.</strong><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>It was, for this purpose, that the Network created the Federal Reserve System.</p>

                    <h2>The Federal Reserve System</h2>

                    <p>In chapter 3, we covered President Taft's undoing: he refused to support the Network's plan to
                        create a central bank in the United States. And since the Network couldn't fully "dominate the
                        political system" of the United States without control of its "credit and money supply," Taft
                        was toppled and Wilson was installed. Shortly after taking office, Wilson signed the Federal
                        Reserve Act into law, and the central bank was born.</p>

                    <p>However, this isn't the full story of how the Federal Reserve System came to be. Just as citizens
                        were misled into believing that <em>they</em> chose Wilson in the 1912 election, they were also
                        misled into believing the Federal Reserve Act was written to protect them from predatory
                        international bankers. The sad truth is, predatory international bankers secretly wrote the
                        legislation themselves and used government to turn their wishes into law.</p>

                    <p>This is a piece of the puzzle that Quigley seems to have missed. He acknowledges that Network
                        titans like Rockefeller and Morgan had enough power to cause a financial panic whenever they
                        chose. He admits that they used their power to their own advantage, wrecking "individual
                        corporations, at the expense of the holders of common stocks." He even admits that J. P. Morgan
                        precipitated the "panic of 1907."<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a> But the
                        fact that their power could have been used to both take out competition <em>and</em> incite
                        public demands for "monetary reform" (<em>reform</em> that would be directed by the Network
                        itself) is not covered. It's a glaring omission.</p>

                    <p>In short, the Network needed a central bank to "dominate the political system" of the United
                        States, but it needed another crisis<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a> to
                        finally sell the scheme. With that perspective in mind, the panic of 1907 looks very different.
                        First, J. P. Morgan <em>causes</em> the panic (which, to this day, is rarely mentioned), then he
                        and Rockefeller <em>halt</em> the panic (for which, to this day, they're <em>still</em>
                        portrayed as saviors), and out of the suffering and chaos, "public demands" for legislative
                        intervention finally reach critical mass. "The government" then forms a monetary commission to
                        investigate and solve the problem (headed by none other than Network insider and US senator,
                        Nelson Aldrich), and the commission decides that a central bank is needed to solve the nation's
                        woes. From there, it was simply a matter of writing the legislation and handing it off to the
                        "right" politicians.</p>

                    <p>Of course, the Network had to conceal the fact that <em>it</em> would be writing the legislation
                        itself, and this presented some problems. The lengths it went to in order to hide its role reads
                        like a scene out of a James Bond novel.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>If you were alive in 1910, you wouldn't have been invited to the meeting…In fact, you would
                            have never known that a meeting took place. Despite the enormous impact on your country's
                            future, the scheme to create a new "monetary system" was none of your business.</p>

                        <p>This is where the story of the Federal Reserve System begins. The banking empires of
                            Rockefeller, Rothschild, Morgan and Warburg…sent [six] representatives on their behalf to
                            the privately owned Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia. To prevent the men from being
                            recognized, the island's permanent employees were sent on vacation and carefully screened
                            temps took their place. Each man was sworn to secrecy and instructed to only use their first
                            name to further conceal their identity. (Nearly two decades passed before any of the
                            conspirators publicly admitted they'd participated in the meeting.) In that meeting, the
                            financial elite created for themselves the monetary system that we live under today.<a
                                href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Had this meeting been covered in the press, the headline might have read: "POWERFUL BANKERS
                        CONSPIRE ON PRIVATE ISLAND TO SEIZE MONETARY CONTROL." But then again, had it been covered in
                        the press, the Federal Reserve Act would have never passed. Citizens wanted Congress to weaken
                        the destructive powers of international banking interests, not expand them.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, the Jekyll Island story didn't leak until 1916<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22"
                            class="footnote">[22]</a>, years after the damage had already been done. And even
                        <em>after</em> it was exposed, "educators, commentators, and historians" continued to deny that
                        the meeting ever took place.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a> Anyone who
                        pointed out the nefarious origins and authors of the Federal Reserve Act was smeared and
                        dismissed as a conspiracy theorist. Fortunately, the truth finally did come out, and the
                        conspiracy theorists were vindicated. Perhaps the most definitive admission came from Frank A.
                        Vanderlip, president of the most powerful New York bank at the time (National City Bank of New
                        York, now Citibank):<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote">[24]</a></p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>There was an occasion near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive—indeed as furtive—as
                            any conspirator…I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to
                            Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal

                            would be wasted. If it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had got
                            together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by
                            Congress…although the Aldrich Federal Reserve plan was defeated when it bore the name of
                            Aldrich, nevertheless its essential points were all contained in the plan that finally was

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Despite this admission over seventy-five years ago, despite other participants and their
                        biographers who've admitted the same, despite the fact that Federal Reserve Chairman (Ben
                        Bernanke) returned to Jekyll Island in 2010 to commemorate the FED's founding one hundred years
                        earlier<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote">[26]</a>; still the vast majority of people
                        have never heard of the trip to Jekyll Island and have <em>no idea</em> that "international
                        bankers" created the system that was supposed to protect them from international bankers.</p>

                    <p>But again, should we be surprised? The education system and mainstream media are the two most
                        powerful instruments for distributing information and creating mass awareness. Regarding the
                        media, just a handful of global news corporations can, in one day, make <em>billions</em> of
                        people around the world simultaneously aware of something that was completely unknown the day
                        before. With this kind of power, the Network can choose to spread any lie, or withhold any
                        truth, that it chooses. Then there is education: millions of students can be taught the real
                        story behind the Federal Reserve System, or they can be taught the smokescreen of "government
                        intervention to protect the public." They can be taught the dangers of centralized banking
                        power, or they can be taught nothing at all. At the end of the day, if people aren't looking
                        beyond the Network's instruments for their information, they cannot expect to know what the
                        Network doesn't want them to know.</p>

                    <p>Even Quigley, apparently, was unaware of the trip to Jekyll Island. He makes no mention of the
                        meeting in either <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> or <em>The Anglo-American Establishment.</em> Since
                        he obviously had no aversion to exposing comparable duplicity, it's reasonable to assume he
                        didn't know that particular part of the Fed's history. Or, perhaps he consulted some of the
                        respected "educators and historians," who convinced him there was no evidence that it ever
                        happened. Whatever the reason, it's an unfortunate oversight. Nothing demonstrates the Network's
                        power more convincingly than its ability to secretly write legislation that governs, or outright
                        <em>creates</em>, its own instruments. And on that note…</p>

                    <p>With its legislation successfully written, Taft ousted, and Wilson in the White House, it would
                        seem that the Network could rest easy. However, there was one more swindle needed to guarantee
                        passage of the Federal Reserve Act. To help garner public support, the <em>very same</em> people
                        who helped author the legislation on Jekyll Island began speaking out publicly <em>against</em>
                        it.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As the Federal Reserve Act moved closer to its birth…both Aldrich and Vanderlip threw
                            themselves into a great public display of opposition. No opportunity was overlooked to make
                            a statement to the press—or anyone else of public prominence—expressing their eternal
                            animosity to this monstrous legislation…Since Aldrich was recognized as associated with the
                            Morgan interests and Vanderlip was President of Rockefeller's National City Bank, the public
                            was skillfully led to believe that the [big bankers were] mortally afraid of the proposed
                            Federal Reserve Act. <em>The Nation</em> was the only prominent publication to point out
                            that every one of the horrors described by Aldrich and Vanderlip could have been equally
                            ascribed to the Aldrich Bill as well. But this lone voice was easily drowned by the great
                            cacophony of deception and propaganda.<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote">[27]</a>

                    <p>The newly packaged Glass-Owen Federal Reserve Act, which mirrored Aldrich's version in "all
                        essential provisions,"<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote">[28]</a> was put forward by
                        Democrats as being radically different; a bill written by selfless public servants to protect
                        the citizenry from selfish, out-of-control banking interests. And as Vanderlip, Aldrich, and
                        other "big-business Republicans" continued to attack the "new" legislation, more and more
                        well-meaning Americans fell for the ruse.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, as the citizens were being guided to the desired opinion publicly, Edward Mandell
                        House ensured that Wilson and Congress were being properly guided privately. <em>The Intimate
                            Papers of Col House</em> leave little doubt that he acted as the direct liaison between the
                        Network and relevant politicians during the creation of the central bank. (House directed the
                        politicians while Paul Warburg, the primary author of the Jekyll Island legislation, directed
                        House.) Ed Griffin summarizes House's role this way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As far as the banking issue was concerned, Colonel House was the President of the United
                            States, and all interested parties knew it. Wilson made no pretense at knowledge of banking
                            theory. He said: "The greatest embarrassment of my political career has been that active
                            duties seem to deprive me of time for careful investigation. I seem almost obligated to form
                            conclusions from impressions instead of from study…I wish that I had more knowledge, more
                            thorough acquaintance, with the matters involved." To which Charles Seymour adds: "Colonel
                            House was indefatigable in providing for the President the knowledge that he sought…The
                            Colonel was the unseen guardian angel of the bill."<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30"

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Here is a perfect example of Quigley's observation: ignorance of banking led politicians to trust
                        the advice of bankers and that this was "consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous
                        for governments…and the people generally." The great irony is that Quigley himself does not seem
                        to fully understand the nature of the banking system. There are a few things in <em>Tragedy and
                            Hope</em> that support this conclusion; I'll cover them briefly.</p>

                    <p>First, on page 58, Quigley presents what he calls a "paradox" of banking practice: bankers prefer
                        monetary deflation (a reduction in the money supply) because it <em>increases</em> both the
                        value of the money that they control and the interest rates that they can charge borrowers.
                        However, he states that they inevitably abandon the "deflationary idea" in favor of inflating
                        the money supply (which they accomplish by issuing bank loans) because of their "eagerness to
                        lend money at interest."</p>

                    <p>To Quigley's credit, he acknowledges that bankers can gain an extra form of <em>profit</em> from
                        this supposed "conflict": by increasing the money supply with loans, they increase the
                        indebtedness of others and drive prices up. Then, by <em>decreasing</em> the money supply, they
                        can force many debtors into foreclosure and confiscate whatever collateral was pledged to secure
                        their loans. He also acknowledges that this manipulation of the money supply was a "prominent
                        aspect" of the so-called "business cycle" and that it was "destructive to business and
                        industry."<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote">[31]</a></p>

                    <p>My question is: Where is the paradox?</p>

                    <p>If you're a member of the Network, this is a fundamental feature of the banking system that
                        you've created. What better way to crush or control competitors in "business and industry"? You
                        not only enjoy the normal benefits of controlling loans (loaning money only to those who yield
                        control and withholding it from those who resist), but you also have a mechanism for trapping
                        debtors and then seizing their assets. If you do decide to confiscate their collateral—rather
                        than bury the borrower in additional debt with additional strings attached—you've effectively
                        gained ownership of a real asset with money that you created out of thin air. (Remember, that's
                        how our current banking system operates. When the Network wants to issue a loan, it pulls a
                        check from its magic checkbook, writes in the loan amount, and <em>poof</em>—the money for the
                        loan is created on the spot.)</p>

                    <p>Quigley states that too much deflation could sometimes be "disastrous" for the bankers because it
                        forced "the value of the collateral below the amount of the loans it secured." Sorry, but even
                        this claim needs addressed. An unpaid principal loan balance of say $100,000, secured by an
                        asset that sells for only $80,000 (or less), does not necessarily equal a loss for the bank.<a
                            href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote">[32]</a> And if the goal is to drive a competitor
                        into bankruptcy, then the math involving so-called "losses" gets even more interesting. What
                        <em>appears</em> to be a loss on paper (due to a gap between the amount of principal owed on a
                        loan and what is ultimately obtained during liquidation) can actually be viewed as a great
                        investment. Sure, a portion of the dollars (created out of thin air) are not fully repaid, but
                        that "cost" is minor compared to what it would have cost to purchase the competitor outright.
                        Add in the <em>dividends</em> of market consolidation, and the return on investment is simply
                        <em>fantastic</em>.</p>

                    <p>Next, there is the issue of the gold standard. Here again, it seems that Quigley has fallen for a
                        false narrative: in this case, that the gold standard was the most sophisticated mechanism of
                        monetary control that the elite could devise. That <em>gold</em> (rather than the control of
                        money and debt, which gold only facilitated) was the root of their monetary power. If these
                        myths are accepted as true, then his assertion that bankers sincerely tried to "save the gold
                        standard" makes perfect sense. However, a closer look at their actions (and the ways in which
                        they benefited from those actions), leads to a more logical conclusion: it was far more
                        profitable to destroy the gold standard than it was to preserve it. To create ever-increasing
                        piles of money and debt out of thin air, the limitations of gold had to be removed.</p>

                    <p>On pages 256 and 257 of <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, Quigley nearly stumbles into the truth. While
                        discussing the beginning of World War I, he tells the story of military men and financial
                        experts who believed the war would be over within six months. This prediction was based on the
                        fact that gold reserves (used to pay for the expenses of war) would be depleted within that
                        amount of time. However, by <em>suspending</em> the gold standard, the duration of the war
                        (along with the enormous debts and banker profits associated with it), grew far beyond anything
                        that a gold standard would have supported.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>All the Great Powers were on the gold standard under which…<strong>paper money could be
                                converted into gold on demand</strong>. However, each country suspended the gold
                            standard at the outbreak of war. <strong>This removed the automatic limitation on the supply
                                of paper money</strong>…each country proceeded to pay for the war by borrowing from the
                            banks. The banks <strong>created the money</strong> which they lent by merely giving the
                            government a deposit of any size against which the government could draw checks. <strong>The
                                banks were no longer limited in the amount of credit they could create because they no
                                longer had to pay out gold for checks on demand</strong>…the problem of public debt
                            became steadily worse because governments were financing such a large part of their
                            activities by bank credit.<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>From this perspective, the advantages of permanently "suspending" the gold standard are
                        self-evident. When a bank creates "paper money" loans that are backed by gold, it runs the risk
                        of losing its gold reserves. When a bank creates paper money loans that are backed by
                        <em>nothing</em>, then its gold reserves are perfectly safe. Additionally, without gold backing,
                        there are no longer any firm limits on how many loans the banking system can create. Limits, if
                        any, are determined by the wishes of those who control the system and the limitless borrowing
                        needs of government, business, and individuals.</p>

                    <p>Last but not least, Quigley asserts multiple times that the reins of power passed from "financial
                        capitalism" to "monopoly capitalism" with the destruction of the gold standard.<a href="#fn34"
                            id="fnref34" class="footnote">[34]</a> (Once again, implying a loss of gold backing equaled
                        a loss for those who wielded banking power.)</p>

                    <p>It would be easy enough to dismiss this supposed shift in power as a distinction without a
                        difference because, at most, it amounted to a shift in methods of control rather than a shift in
                        management. (The same Network that controlled financial capitalism paved the way for monopoly
                        capitalism, and the primary leader of the Network, Lord Milner himself, had written of his
                        desire to abandon the gold standard as early as 1923.)<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35"
                            class="footnote">[35]</a> But there is a larger point to be made here.</p>

                    <p>If "monopoly capitalism" is <em>all powerful</em> because it can self-finance, manipulate the
                        price of goods within its market, and use its inflated monopolistic profits to wield monetary
                        influence, then there are no words to sufficiently describe the power of "financial capitalism."
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Not only can financial capitalists "self-finance," they can do so by simply creating money
                            out of thin air and loaning it to others at interest. (What could possibly be more powerful
                            than that?)</li>

                        <li>Not only can financial capitalists manipulate the price of goods in a <em>particular</em>
                            market, they can manipulate the price of goods in <em>any</em> market. (Real estate, food,
                            energy, stocks, bonds, education…anything that has a price will be affected by those who
                            manipulate the quantity and flow of money.)</li>

                        <li>Not only do financial capitalists enjoy the influence of monopolistic profits, they enjoy
                            the influence of having monopolized the creation of money itself. Stated another way: when a
                            "monopoly capitalist" accumulates his first billion dollars, it's only because others have
                            borrowed that billion dollars into existence from the Network's banking system.<a
                                href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote">[36]</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If Quigley truly understood the Network's banking system, he would have never fallen for the lie,
                        undoubtedly perpetuated by the Network itself, that banking power peaked in the 1930s. The exact
                        opposite is true. It wasn't until the 1930s that international bankers began chipping away at
                        the limitations of gold and inching the world ever closer to a purely debt-based standard.</p>

                    <p>As powerful as the Network's position was under the gold standard, it has increased immeasurably
                        under their 100-percent debt-based standard. They can now create, destroy, and direct as much
                        money as they see fit. They currently earn interest on every single dollar in existence, because
                        every single dollar in existence has been <em>created and loaned</em> into the economy by them.
                    </p>

                    <p>Accordingly, their debt-based system guarantees that nations will remain forever trapped in debt.
                        (As a nation and its citizens attempt to reduce their debt to bankers, they simultaneously
                        reduce their nation's money supply. Paying off <em>all</em> debt would reduce the money supply
                        to zero…not only would this be impossible, but financial chaos and "emergency government
                        borrowing" would be triggered long before any significant reduction in debt was achieved.) This
                        is <em>not</em> a system that was designed with our best interests in mind.</p>

                    <p>In the next chapter, we'll cover the Network's banking system in more detail. We'll also cover
                        the steps that we must take to free ourselves from their illegitimate monetary control.</p>

                        <p>[2] It's worth noting that this period of "financial capitalism" clearly predates the

                            that the real roots of the Rhodes network (and the real power) existed long before Cecil
                            Rhodes entered the picture. However, since this book focuses on the <em>proven</em>
                            conspiracy (identified and exposed by Quigley), a detailed account of what existed before

                        <p>[11] A <em>temporary</em> income tax was imposed by Lincoln to fund the Civil War in 1861.
                            Though the tax outlived the war, it ended circa 1873. An attempt in 1894 to create a
                            <em>permanent</em> income tax was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court a year later
                            (see: Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company). It wasn't until 1913, with the passage of
                            the sixteenth amendment, that our current federal income tax came to be. <a

                        <p>[20] The panics of 1873 and 1893 caused widespread suffering and stirred demands for monetary
                            reform. Public opinion was already leaning heavily toward the need for legislative
                            intervention, and the panic of 1907 provided the final push. If the idea that bankers would
                            actually create a panic to serve their interests seems like a stretch, consider the case of
                            Nicholas Biddle. As President Andrew Jackson was trying to shut down Biddle's 2nd Bank of
                            the United States, the banker intentionally crashed the economy and blamed the ensuing
                            financial crisis on Jackson. This served to turn public opinion <em>against</em> Jackson and
                            in favor of the bank. Discussing the tactic, Biddle commented, "Nothing but widespread
                            suffering will produce any effect on Congress…Our only safety is in pursuing a steady course
                            of firm restriction…I have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to…recharter of
                            the Bank." Referring to Jackson, Biddle remarked, "This worthy President thinks that because
                            he has scalped Indians and imprisoned Judges, he is to have his way with the Bank. He is
                            mistaken." (As quoted in <em>The Creature from Jekyll Island</em>, page 354) <a

                        <p>[32] As a simple example, consider an interest-only loan on $100,000 at 6 percent interest.
                            At the end of five years, the debtor defaults, and the asset is sold for only $80,000. In
                            this case it looks like the bank has lost money (the debtor still owed $100,000, and the
                            bank only recovered $80,000 from the sale of the asset). However, if you factor in the
                            INTEREST payments that were made over five years ($30,000), you see that the bank actually
                            walks away with a profit of $10,000 ($80,000 sale price + $30,000 in interest payments equal
                            $110,000). In rare instances, the bankers might actually lose some of the dollars that they
                            created out of thin air for a loan. When that happens, those "losses" tend to be turned to
                            profits via "government" bailouts <a href="#fnref32">↩</a></p>
