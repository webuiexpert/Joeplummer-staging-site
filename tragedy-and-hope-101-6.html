                            dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers."

                    <p>In the Declaration of Independence, we find the primary argument for establishing government
                        power: to secure the rights of the people. Without some type of protection mechanism in place,
                        criminals will prey on the population without fear of consequences. They will do as they please
                        to those who are too weak to resist them.</p>

                    <p>In the exact same document, we find the primary argument for <em>limiting</em> or
                        <em>revoking</em> government power: to secure the rights of the people. Without some type of
                        protection mechanism in place, criminals will gain control of government and use its power to
                        prey on the population. They will do as they please to those who are too weak to resist them.
                        (They will never use the power of government to prosecute and punish themselves.)
                    </p>

                    <p>The first argument (government can protect us from crime) is still alive and well. In fact, it's
                        drilled relentlessly into every citizen's head from a very early age. However, the second
                        argument (government can actually <em>subject us</em> to crime) has practically disappeared from
                        politically correct conversation. This, despite the fact that the <em>threat</em> posed by
                        criminals in government far exceeds any threat posed by common criminals. If there is any doubt,
                        consider the following:</p>

                    <p>Common criminals do not have access to the media, the trust of the masses, or the air of
                        legitimacy given to those who secure a position of <em>authority</em>. They cannot legally seize
                        our money, destroy the purchasing power of our currency, or control the police and military.
                        Common criminals cannot <em>legislate away</em> our rights, or reduce our children to debt
                        slaves. They cannot obstruct an inquiry into their crimes from <em>inside</em> the system. (They
                        cannot seal documents, confiscate and "lose" evidence, or appoint their own investigators.)
                        Common criminals cannot write laws and <em>selectively</em> enforce them. They cannot disarm
                        millions of their would-be victims, round them up and put them in cages, or worse. They cannot
                        take nations to war, profiting financially and politically from the carnage…</p>

                    <p>Suffice to say, <em>this</em> is why those who created the US government spoke constantly about
                        limiting its power via the Constitution and Bill of Rights. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the
                        <em>Kentucky Resolutions of 1798</em>, too much confidence in our elected leaders' good
                        intentions is the "parent of despotism everywhere." It would be a "dangerous delusion," he
                        warned, for us to trust those who currently hold power simply because they are "men of our
                        choice."
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"In questions of power…let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from
                            mischief by the chains of the Constitution."</p>
                        <p class="quote-attribution">—Thomas Jefferson, Kentucky Resolutions</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Members of the Network have spent the past one hundred years doing everything in their power to
                        nurture the "dangerous delusion" that Jefferson warned us about. Before they can have their way
                        with the world, our rulers must break the "chains of the Constitution" that bind them down. They
                        don't want to exercise <em>limited</em> government power; they want to exercise the opposite.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded…War is the
                            parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes…and armies, and debts, and taxes are
                            the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few…No nation could
                            preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."</p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In chapter 1, we briefly covered the 1950s-era investigations into large, tax-exempt foundations.
                        Many were shocked when it was discovered that the <em>capitalist</em> foundations were using
                        their money to support <em>Communism</em>. At first glance, this seems ridiculous. Why would the
                        wealthiest men in the world want to "orient American far eastern policies toward Communist
                        objectives?"<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a> This seemingly suicidal policy
                        begins to make more sense when you learn how the Network actually operates. It's important to
                        remember that war, and the <em>threat</em> of war, has enabled them (more than anything else) to
                        inch ever closer to their goal of destroying national sovereignty.</p>

                    <p>Norman Dodd was the lead researcher for one of the aforementioned investigations<a href="#fn4"
                            id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a> and, as such, he was chosen to appoint the committee's
                        staff. By the 1950s, propaganda touting the humanitarian "benevolence" of the tax-exempt
                        foundations was widely accepted and many people, including one of Dodd's researchers, Katherine
                        Casey, felt that the foundations were beyond reproach. As Dodd put it, Casey was "unsympathetic
                        to the purpose of the investigation. Her attitude…was: 'What could possibly be wrong with
                        foundations? They do so much good.'"<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a> But
                        Casey's trust was soon shattered as she dug into what was, at the time, decades-old records of
                        the Network-connected Carnegie Foundation. Dodd explains:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>I blocked out certain periods of time [for Casey] to concentrate on, and off she went to New
                            York. She came back at the end of two weeks with the following on Dictaphone tapes:</p>

                        <p>"We are now at the year 1908…In that year, the trustees…raised a specific question, which
                            they discussed throughout the balance of the year in a very learned fashion. The question
                            is: <strong>'Is there any means known more effective than war, assuming you wish to alter
                                the life of an entire people?'</strong> And they conclude that no more effective means
                            than war to that end is known to humanity. So then, in 1909, they raised the second question
                            and discussed it, namely: <strong>'How do we involve the United States in a
                                war?'</strong>…Then, finally, they answered that question as follows: <strong>'We must
                                control the State Department.'</strong> That very naturally raises the question of how
                            do we do that? And they answer it by saying: <strong>'We must take over and control the
                                diplomatic machinery of this country.'</strong> And, finally, they resolve to aim at
                            that as an objective."</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Keep in mind, the plans that Casey is reporting on were originally written just a few years
                        <em>before</em> the Network managed to gain control of the "diplomatic machinery" of the country
                        (using Woodrow Wilson and Mandell House). That control was later expanded via the Network-led
                        group of "experts" known as <em>The Inquiry</em>. The Inquiry, in turn, evolved into what is now
                        known as the Council on Foreign Relations. Within twenty years of its founding, the CFR's
                        enormous power within the State Department was undeniable. (Look no further than the 1939
                        <em>War and Peace Studies</em> for an excellent example.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"
                            class="footnote">[6]</a>) Casey's report continues:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Then time passes, and we are eventually in a war, which would be World War I. At that time
                            they record on their minutes a shocking report in which they dispatched to President Wilson
                            a telegram, cautioning him to see that the war does not end too quickly. Finally, of course,
                            the war is over. At that time their interest shifts over to preventing what they call a
                            reversion of life in the United States to what it was prior to 1914 when World War I broke
                            out. At that point they came to the conclusion that, to prevent a reversion, <em>'we must
                                control education in the United States.'</em>…They realize that that's a pretty big
                            task…They then decide that the key to success…lay in the alteration of the teaching of
                            American history."<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>According to Norman Dodd, Casey was so devastated by the information she uncovered during the
                        Reece Committee investigation that she never recovered.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As far as its impact on Katherine Casey was concerned…she never was able to return to her law
                            practice. Ultimately, she lost her mind as a result of it. It was a terrible shock. It's a
                            very rough experience to encounter proof of these kinds.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"
                                class="footnote">[8]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>That final sentence is profound. It actually <em>is</em> a very "rough experience to encounter
                        proof" that you've been intentionally misled. It is <em>painful</em> to learn that intelligent,
                        manipulative, and arrogant liars have secured your well-meaning trust, only then to play you as
                        a fool. <em>Nobody</em> wants to face that feeling and, as it relates to "our" powerful
                        institutions, that feeling gets worse before it gets better. After discovering the initial
                        betrayal, you come to realize that your trust has been betrayed at every turn. You realize that
                        the entire system has been <em>designed</em> to deceive and trap you (along with the rest of the
                        unsuspecting public) in a fabricated reality, in an illusion.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps worst of all, after some study and serious thought, you begin to comprehend the enormity
                        of the problem. The same institutional propaganda that initially fooled <em>you</em> still holds
                        sway over millions and millions of minds. To unlock those minds, you must convince people to
                        investigate ugly truths that, to them, seem ridiculous and offensive. You have to overcome the
                        fact that most people will be "unsympathetic to the purpose" of <em>any</em> investigation that
                        challenges their deeply held beliefs.</p>

                    <p>Katherine Casey uncovered a criminal conspiracy that was so inherently immoral, and so at odds
                        with popular perception, that few people would ever believe the story was true. And, since we
                        don't have access to the documents she saw, healthy skepticism is perfectly reasonable. So,
                        moving forward, let's assume that all we have to go on is a few general assertions:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Members of the Network believe they have a <em>right</em> to rule in secrecy.</li>
                        <li>By controlling policy and public perception, they have the <em>ability</em> to do so.</li>
                        <li>Because of their power within the political system, their crimes are rarely exposed and
                            never properly punished.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Throughout the remainder of this book, I will prove that these three assertions are true.</p>

                    <p>Like Katherine Casey, my world view changed forever when I stumbled across a document that I was
                        never supposed to read. Coincidently, the secret document I saw also pertained to war;
                        specifically, a plan to involve the United States in a war by convincing its citizens, its
                        government, and its military that the nation had been attacked. The ugly truth (that the attack
                        was to be an inside job) would be known only to a handful of individuals at the apex of power.
                        Its success, like nearly everything the Network does, would rest on the exploitation of
                        humanitarian impulses and the betrayal of public trust.</p>

                    <p>To really understand how easy it is for the Network to deceive a trusting public, let's begin
                        with a thought experiment. Imagine the following hypothetical scenario:</p>

                    <p>The president of the United States appears on national television and announces that Iran has
                        shot down a civilian airliner filled with two hundred American students. There are no survivors.
                        The only thing that remains of the plane, its passengers, and its crew is the frantic tape of
                        the pilot's final transmission: "Mayday, mayday, we're being tailed by an Iranian fighter…We
                        need help up here and fast…Mayday, do you copy?," followed by the sound of an explosion, frantic
                        screams, and then silence.</p>

                    <p>As the media plays the chilling audio over and over again (pausing periodically to interview
                        grieving parents who have lost their children), the president assures the horrified and outraged
                        public that the United States will act both swiftly and decisively. "We will not sit idly by as
                        our nation's children are murdered in cold blood. This crazed and arrogant Iranian regime has
                        been tolerated long enough, and it will now be brought to justice. I have instructed the
                        secretary of defense to have a preliminary course of action prepared and on my desk by morning."
                    </p>

                    <p>In this hypothetical scenario, very few people would have any desire whatsoever to stop the
                        looming military confrontation. Quite the contrary—having been properly whipped into an
                        emotional frenzy, they would cheer the "retaliatory" strike every step of the way. Even those
                        who <em>did</em> question the wisdom and potential consequences of a war with Iran would be
                        unlikely to speak up. They'd only be shouted down by an angry media-driven mob if they did. This
                        is all basic human psychology; it is perfectly predictable. Equally predictable are the odds of
                        anyone having any patience for an alternative narrative, especially a narrative that shifts
                        blame from the well-established villain (Iran) to the well-meaning hero (the US government).</p>

                    <p>If you doubt this, just imagine some "conspiracy nut" standing up and stating the following:
                        "It's all a lie! Iran is innocent! Our government was behind the whole thing! They loaded a
                        civilian airliner with <em>fake</em> passengers, flew the plane to a secret location, unloaded
                        the fake passengers, and replaced the original plane with a remote-controlled drone. They then
                        had a <em>fake</em> Iranian fighter jet (it was really an American fighter painted to <em>look
                            like</em> an Iranian fighter) chase after the remote-controlled drone. Then, they
                        transmitted a fake "Mayday" signal from the drone just before blowing it up! It was all a setup
                        so we could frame and attack Iran!"</p>

                    <p>What percentage of the trusting public could believe that <em>their</em> government would
                        conspire to do something so utterly ridiculous and insane? Probably zero percent. Unless, of
                        course, the trusting public's understanding of how "their government" actually operates was
                        revealed to them via some shocking proof—some shocking proof that the "conspiracy nut" was
                        right. Well, substitute Iran for Cuba, and you've got a nearly perfect description of the
                        Northwoods Document.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>

                    <p>The Northwoods Document was an official US government plan to manipulate the people into
                        supporting an unnecessary and illegal war. In the document, its authors propose many "pretexts"
                        to achieve their aim: everything from <em>creating</em> a "terror campaign" in the United States
                        to having covert US agents carry out attacks against US targets and then blaming Cuba for the
                        attacks. It even speaks of completely fabricating an attack by using <em>fake</em> planes,
                        <em>fake</em> passengers, remote-control drone aircraft, a <em>faked</em> mayday call, and a
                        <em>faked</em> "shoot down." Sound unbelievable? It did to me as well, but then I read it for
                        myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here is the related text, excerpted directly from the Northwoods Document:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As requested by Chief of Operations, Cuba Project, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are to indicate
                            brief but precise description of pretexts which they consider would provide justification
                            for US military intervention in Cuba…all projects are suggested within the time frame of the
                            next few months.</p>

                        <p>It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban
                            aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner…The passengers could be a
                            group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest
                            to support chartering a non-scheduled flight.</p>

                        <p>a. An aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate
                            for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization…At a designated
                            time, the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded
                            with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual
                            registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.</p>

                        <p>b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a
                            rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will
                            descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin Air Force Base
                            where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to
                            its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight
                            plan. When over Cuba the drone will begin transmitting on the international distress
                            frequency a 'May Day' message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The
                            transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by
                            radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the US
                            what has happened to the aircraft instead of the US trying to "sell" the incident.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Immediately prior to the proposal above, the document suggests having US military pilots threaten
                        civilian aircraft with fake "MIG type aircraft." (This presumably would make a later "shoot
                        down" that much more believable.)</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>An F-86 properly painted would convince air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG, especially
                            if the pilot of the transport were to announce such fact…reasonable copies of the MIG could
                            be produced from US resources in about three months.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As noted, these plans were drafted in support of the larger Cuba Project, which was essentially a
                        CIA-directed covert operation against Cuba. The Cuba Project contained many other equally
                        immoral and dishonest proposals. One such proposal involved having the United States attack
                        Jamaica and then blame the attack on Cuba.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Included in the nations the Joint Chiefs suggested as targets for covert attacks were Jamaica
                            and Trinidad-Tobago. Since both were members of the British Commonwealth, the Joint Chiefs
                            hoped that by secretly attacking them and then falsely blaming Cuba, the United States could
                            incite the people of the United Kingdom into supporting a war against Castro.<a href="#fn10"
                                id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>A plan was even put forward that suggested bribing a Cuban commander to launch an attack against
                        the US military base at Guantanamo Bay. As James Bamford notes: "The act suggested—bribing a
                        foreign nation to launch a violent attack on an American military installation—was treason."<a
                            href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>

                    <p>It's imperative to understand that covert operations of this nature rely on the
                        <em>ignorance</em> of both the public <em>and</em> the vast majority of government and military
                        personnel. (The whole point of a covert operation is to deceive; to get away with something you
                        would otherwise be unable to get away with.) Regarding these and other proposals, a Department
                        of Defense report stated clearly:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>If the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation it should be one in which
                            participation by U.S. personnel is limited only to the most highly trusted covert personnel.
                            This suggests the infeasibility of the use of military units for any aspect of the contrived
                            situation.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As part of the Cuba Project, Operation Northwoods was approved through the highest chain of
                        command all the way up to the president of the United States. Fortunately, President Kennedy's
                        opinion of the CIA and its tactics had already soured by the time the document hit his desk, and
                        he rejected it. If he hadn't, this plan would have no doubt led to an unnecessary war and the
                        death of many thousands based on total lies. Even worse, it could have easily led to a nuclear
                        exchange with Russia and <em>millions dead</em>, based on lies.</p>

                    <div class="side-note">
                        <p class="side-note-title">Side Note:</p>
                        <p>Kennedy's negative opinion of the Network-created CIA is summed up nicely in the following
                            quote: "I want to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds."<a
                                href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a> Many people, for good reason,
                            believe the CIA played a direct role in both the murder of JFK and the cover-up that
                            followed. That topic is beyond the scope of this book. However, just for reference, books
                            like <em>JFK and the Unspeakable</em> do an excellent job of revealing the power struggle
                            that emerged between Kennedy and his foreign policy "advisors" once he began moving the
                            nation's foreign policy in an unapproved direction.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>When I first read Operation Northwoods, I was still like Katherine Casey—terribly naïve. In my
                        imaginary world, any individual who conspired to facilitate terrorist attacks against the United
                        States<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote">[14]</a> would be viewed as a terrorist and
                        punished severely. Any group of <em>public servants</em> who set out to frame another nation for
                        a crime it didn't commit, kill innocent people, and deceive the nation into an illegal war would
                        be brought up on charges and thrown in prison for a very long time. But as I searched for
                        information on how these conspirators were held accountable, I found nothing: no charges, no
                        trials, no punishment.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a> It was as if
                        deception, murder, and even <em>treason</em> were all acceptable just so long as the crimes were
                        committed at the behest of the most powerful members of society. It didn't look anything like
                        the "justice, freedom, and democracy" that I learned about in school. And as I dug deeper, it
                        only got worse…much worse.</p>

                    <p>In 1998, Daniele Ganser was looking for a PhD research topic, and, against the advice of his
                        friends and professors, he decided to tackle the gigantic task of unraveling "Operation Gladio."
                        Beginning with a single document that proved the CIA and NATO <em>created</em> a secret
                        terrorist army in Italy, he embarked on a four-year investigation that uncovered an additional
                        <em>fifteen</em> secret armies in NATO countries and four more that were created in neutral
                        countries.
                    </p>

                    <p>There are many well-worn lies about the nature of our "leaders" and what they're capable of. The
                        most obvious lie (to those who are paying attention) is that they respect national sovereignty,
                        democracy, and "the will of the people." <em>Nothing</em> could be further from the truth, and
                        Operation Gladio provides an excellent case in point. Gladio also underscores two key arguments
                        that I've put forward in this book, which are:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The Network has mastered the art of pursuing its sovereignty-destruction project while
                            maintaining the illusion of democracy, and</li>
                        <li>Its members operate above the moral and legislative laws that others are expected to abide
                            by.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>To address these points properly, we must first expand on some of the Network's handiwork prior
                        to its implementation of Gladio following World War II. Unfortunately, because there is so much
                        ground to cover, Gladio is going to have to wait until chapter 8.</p>

                    <h2>World War I, the League of Nations, and Debt Traps</h2>

                    <p>By manipulating the election of 1912, the Network brought Woodrow Wilson to power and effectively
                        gained control of the "diplomatic machinery" of the United States. If, as Katherine Casey
                        reported, the ultimate aim was to maneuver the United States into a war capable of altering "the
                        life of an entire people," the Network was well on its way. All it needed now was the war
                        itself, and, as luck would have it, Europe was already a powder keg that was primed and ready to
                        explode. Henry Kissinger explains the political climate that preceded World War I this way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The astonishing aspect of the First World War is…that it took so long for it to happen…The
                            statesmen of all the major countries had helped to construct [a] diplomatic doomsday
                            mechanism.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote">[16]</a></p>

                        <p>The unholy mix of general political alliances and hair-trigger military strategies guaranteed
                            a vast bloodletting…Foreign policy…now consisted of gambling on a single throw of the dice.
                            A more mindless and technocratic approach to war would have been difficult to imagine.<a
                                href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In June 1914, the so-called Black Hand<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a>
                        reached into Europe and set the "doomsday mechanism" into motion by assassinating Franz
                        Ferdinand. The "vast bloodletting" followed shortly thereafter and, low and behold, the Network
                        had its war. Now it was simply a matter of dragging the war on long enough for their carefully
                        selected puppet (Woodrow Wilson) to sell "his" divinely inspired plan for US intervention and a
                        New World Order.</p>

                    <p>With the carnage of World War I as a backdrop and with the father of propaganda, Edward Bernays,
                        at his side,<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a> Wilson began stirring support
                        for the League of Nations that he'd been writing about since at least 1887.<a href="#fn20"
                            id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a> Following "his" plan, the world would be led into a
                        new and peaceful era where all nations, great and small, would be protected from unjust
                        aggression and the violation of their sovereignty. Touting American principles, Wilson declared
                        in May 1916:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>We believe these fundamental things: First, that every people has a right to choose the
                            sovereignty under which they shall live…Second, that the small states of the world have a
                            right to enjoy the same respect for their sovereignty and for their territorial integrity
                            that great and powerful nations expect and insist upon. And, third, that the world has a
                            right to be free from every disturbance of its peace that has its origin in aggression and
                            disregard of the rights of peoples and nations.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21"
                                class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This lofty rhetoric, coupled with the outrage of a recent "surprise" attack on the "passenger
                        liner" <em>Lusitania</em><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote">[22]</a>, allowed the
                        Network to steadily move the United States toward entering the European conflict. As it had done
                        with the Federal Reserve System and income tax, the Network skillfully manipulated public
                        opinion until it overcame the nation's strong antiwar sentiment. World War I, the people were
                        assured, was a war that would end all wars. It would "make the world safe for democracy" and
                        lead mankind into a new era of respect for the rights of man. It was the duty of every
                        liberty-loving citizen of the United States to support it, because no moral human could possibly
                        oppose such ends.</p>

                    <p>Of course, if the utopian carrot wasn't enough, the Network also had a stick in its back pocket
                        that it used to great effect. One week after a German torpedo sunk the <em>Lusitania</em>,
                        killing nearly all Americans onboard, Professor Knock informs us:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Americans barely had the chance to digest this assault [when] the British government released
                            an official report on German atrocities, bearing the name…of Viscount James Bryce, the
                            esteemed former Ambassador to the United States. [Bryce was a member of what Quigley
                            referred to as the second generation of the Network's "Cecil Bloc."<a href="#fn23"

                            some 1,200 alleged acts of barbarism and cruelty committed by German soldiers, primarily
                            against Belgians—including the crucifixion and decapitation of prisoners of war, the gang
                            rape and sexual mutilation of women, the hacking off of children's fingers for souvenirs,
                            and the bayoneting of infants. Although much of it was later proved to be fictional…Germany
                            would never fully recover from the revulsion that swept the United States.<a href="#fn24"
                                id="fnref24" class="footnote">[24]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This carrot-and-stick propaganda campaign produced the desired result. The United States
                        eventually entered the war, and a constitutional abomination known as the Espionage Act was used
                        to silence any remaining skeptics and dissenters. (Apparently, making the world "safe for
                        democracy" meant demonizing and jailing US citizens who continued to voice their opposition.
                        Opposition disrupted the campaign to establish "patriotic conformity,"<a href="#fn25"
                            id="fnref25" class="footnote">[25]</a> and so it could not be tolerated.) But the skeptics
                        and dissenters were inevitably vindicated. At the war's end, the reality of power politics
                        reared its ugly head. Quigley explains:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The peoples of the victorious nations had taken to heart their wartime propaganda about the
                            rights of small nations, making the world safe for democracy, and putting an end both to
                            power politics and to secret diplomacy. These ideals had been given concrete form in Woodrow
                            Wilson's Fourteen Points…the defeated powers had been promised…that the peace settlements
                            would be negotiated and would be based on the Fourteen Points. When it became clear that
                            <strong>the settlements were to be imposed rather than negotiated…that the terms of the
                                settlements had been reached by a process of secret negotiations from which the small
                                nations had been excluded and in which power politics played a much larger role than the
                                safety of democracy</strong>, there was a revulsion of feeling against the treaties.<a

                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Though the "peoples of the victorious nations" might have felt betrayed, members of the Network
                        had plenty of reasons to celebrate. Up to this point, they had achieved nearly every one of
                        their aims: from the Wilson coup in 1912 to the Federal Reserve System and income tax; from
                        maneuvering the United States into war, to creating a League of Nations that they would
                        ultimately control. However, it was on this final point, the League of Nations, where the
                        Network came up short.</p>

                    <p>When Wilson was forced to admit that the United States would have to cede sovereignty in order
                        for the League to work, opposition within the US Senate began to grow.<a href="#fn27"
                            id="fnref27" class="footnote">[27]</a> In an attempt to overcome this opposition, he
                        delivered yet another one of his messianic speeches in July 1919. The League of Nations, Wilson
                        declared, was:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The indispensable instrumentality for the maintenance of the new order…Dare we reject it and
                            break the heart of the world?…The stage is set, the destiny disclosed. It has come about by
                            no plan of our conceiving, but by the hand of God who led us into this way. We cannot turn
                            back. We can only go forward, with lifted eyes and freshened spirit, to follow the vision.
                            It was of this that we dreamed at our birth. America shall in truth show the way. The light
                            streams upon the path ahead, and nowhere else.<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28"
                                class="footnote">[28]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>But no amount of lofty rhetoric or appeals to emotion would suffice. The League would clearly
                        undermine US sovereignty, and Wilson was unable to rally enough support within the Senate to
                        overcome this objection. In November 1919, after months of debate, the US Senate voted
                        <em>not</em> to join.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote">[29]</a> However, this isn't
                        to suggest that the Network's efforts had been in vain. A great deal of money had been made
                        during the war, competing empires had been destroyed, power had been consolidated, and dozens of
                        nations <em>had</em> joined the League. The Network simply had some more work to do within the
                        United States, and "more work" it did. Aside from increasing its control over government using
                        the Inquiry, the CFR, and other well-connected instruments, it also began increasing its
                        financial control with its new monetary weapon, the Federal Reserve System.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Stealing Gold and Creating Debt</h2>

                    <p>After World War I, the Federal Reserve began artificially inflating the US dollar supply. Quigley
                        informs us that this was done, in large part, to allow gold to be drained from the United States
                        (for Britain's benefit) without triggering a corresponding reduction in the number of US dollars
                        in circulation.<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote">[30]</a> The newly printed Fed
                        money flowed into the stock market, inflated the bubble of the Roaring Twenties, and inevitably
                        led to the stock market crash of 1929 and the economic devastation of the Great Depression.
                        (This too helped to "alter the life of an entire people.")</p>

                    <p>Making economic matters worse, Britain went off the gold standard completely in 1931, and this
                        predictably intensified the depletion of US gold. (Nations that could no longer redeem their
                        paper receipts for gold in Britain now turned to the United States.) Since the US was "the only
                        gold standard country with gold coins still circulating," gold poured out of the country.
                        Additionally, concerned US citizens began redeeming large quantities of <em>their</em> dollars
                        for gold too, and "the US banking system began to collapse."<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31"
                            class="footnote">[31]</a></p>

                    <p>This pressure on the banking system continued until 1933 when the Network convinced President
                        Roosevelt (FDR) to confiscate US citizens' gold and hand it over to the Federal Reserve.<a
                            href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote">[32]</a> By making it illegal for US citizens to
                        redeem their dollars in gold, the Federal Reserve (in cooperation with policy makers within the
                        federal government) could now begin printing ever-larger piles of debt money while increasing
                        their own power in the process. As covered in chapter 4, a heavily indebted government is much
                        easier to control than one that is financially sound. Even Quigley admits that making gold
                        illegal in the United States was not necessary. He states that it was done "in order to pursue a
                        policy of price inflation…it was not made necessary by the American international financial
                        position."<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a> It's also worth noting that
                        Mandell House, more than twenty years after advising Woodrow Wilson, was an advisor to FDR as
                        well.</p>

                    <p>If the Network <em>always</em> seeks to trap nations in debt (it does), then a review of the
                        growth in US federal debt should be instructive (and it is). In the twenty years <em>prior</em>
                        to Wilson's election, the amount of debt the federal government owed increased by just $1.3
                        billion. In the twenty years <em>after</em> Wilson's election, the amount of debt the federal
                        government owed increased by nearly $20 billion.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34"
                            class="footnote">[34]</a> (This massive increase in debt occurred <em>despite</em> the
                        additional revenue provided by the 1913 personal income tax.) But even this $20 billion increase
                        was just a drop in the bucket; fast forward to just after FDR's presidency, and the federal debt
                        had increased by more than $240 billion. And in 2012, it had increased by more than $16,000
                        billion.</p>

                    <p>This information on government debt is vitally important because it plays a major role in the
                        Network's destruction of national sovereignty. Financial warfare is <em>essential</em>, and the
                        basic recipe for conquering a nation financially can be summed up in two simple steps:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Create shortfalls in government revenue. (Either by increasing the amount of money a
                            government spends, decreasing the amount of money a government collects, or both.)</li>
                        <li>Create loans out of thin air to "help" the "leaders" cover their spending shortfalls without
                            correcting the underlying financial imbalance.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>As payments on mounting debt create greater and greater shortfalls, and as annual spending
                        continues to increase unabated, larger and more frequent loans become necessary to bridge the
                        gap. This accelerates the rate at which the national debt grows and, before long, even powerful
                        nations will find themselves utterly dependent on a constant flow of newly borrowed funds to
                        cover their expenses.</p>

                    <p>Once a nation has been trapped in this way, the Network can simply adjust the financial spigot
                        according to the level at which its desires are being met. If a government wants to maintain
                        vital services, social order, and ultimately its own power, it will do what the Network wants
                        (regardless of the will of the people). If the government refuses, the flow of money will be cut
                        and won't be restored until "more acceptable" leaders assume control. And as we'll cover in the
                        next chapter, "acceptable" has nothing to do with how the new leaders treat the citizens that
                        live beneath them.</p>

                        <p>[15] Some have argued that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lyman Lemnitzer, lost
                            his job because of Operation Northwoods and therefore was "punished." But if Lemnitzer was
                            being punished by our government for conspiring to carry out false-flag terror operations,
                            it's odd that he was appointed "Supreme Allied Commander" of NATO. Hardly a demotion, his
                            new post provided the opportunity to "fight communists" exactly the way he wanted.

                            of the government's "campaign for patriotic conformity." For instance, German measles were
                            renamed "Liberty measles," sauerkraut was renamed "Liberty cabbage," and German shepherds
                            were renamed "police dogs." This snowballed into the banning of Brahms and Beethoven from
                            concert halls, the removal and burning of German literature from some schools and public
                            libraries, and even calls (by men like Theodore Roosevelt) to prohibit the teaching of the
                            German language. <a href="#fnref25">↩</a></p>
