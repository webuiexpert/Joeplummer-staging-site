                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> I wrote and recorded this audio program back in 2003 - 2004. At that point, these concepts had helped me improve my life dramatically and also helped me achieve my financial goals.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, the REAL value of these ideas were proven during the 10-year period 2004 - 2014. This is when, to fund a "civic goal" that required full-time research and writing, I exhausted my savings and sold nearly everything I owned. The work itself was very psychologically taxing, and the added financial pressures only added to the challenge, but the age-old ideas outlined in this course helped me finish what I'd started. They kept me moving forward, and my hope is (whatever challenges you face), they'll help you do the same.</p>

                    <p><a href="/1-hour-guide-to-911"><strong>Part 1- No Tinfoil Hat Required:</strong></a> So let's get to the point: Is it REALLY baseless idiocy that drives people to question the official account of 911? Are the millions of Americans (which include Senators, FBI agents, Doctors, Lawyers, Professors, Scientists, Engineers, etc.) all paranoid loons for suggesting a TRULY independent investigation of 911 is needed? --Continue Reading</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="/1-hour-guide-to-911"><strong>Part 2 - The Reason They Lie:</strong></a> The history of unchecked power is clear; its tyrannical course, unavoidable. Over and over we have seen the maxim "absolute power corrupts absolutely" played out before us. Personally, I believe those who seek absolute power are already corrupt, but there's no need to split hairs; in the end the same holds true: It is never absurd to question the statements, motives, or actions of extremely powerful people. To the contrary, all evidence suggests it is absurd not to. --Continue Reading</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="/1-hour-guide-to-911"><strong>Part 3 - The Cover Up:</strong></a> The evidence to support the government's claim that fire destroyed all three buildings has no basis in reality...the "evidence" exists only in the form of words. There is no historical data to back their assertions, only historical data to refute them. No models have been able to physically reproduce the phenomena they describe because (as expected) the laws of physics cannot be violated. --Continue Reading</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="/1-hour-guide-to-911"><strong>Part 4 - The Evidence:</strong></a> For the record, few in the scientific community doubt that it's theoretically possible for a building to experience failure if it is subjected to devastating heat for a sufficient period of time. And additional factors like no fire-proofing, no sprinkler systems, insufficient steel to "bleed off" heat or inferior construction greatly increase the possibility. However, what is "doubted" (or more accurately; considered downright impossible) is that such a failure would resemble anything like what was witnessed on 9/11. ...Gradual, isolated, asymmetrical failures spread out over time; perhaps. Simultaneous disintegration of all load bearing columns (leaving a pile of neatly folded rubble a few stories high), no way. --Continue Reading</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="/1-hour-guide-to-911"><strong>Closing Summary - The 911 Truth Movement:</strong></a>
                    The main goal of the 9/11 truth movement is (logically enough) to uncover the truth of what really happened on 9/11. Those charged with writing the official government theory (the 9/11 Commission) promised us "the fullest possible account." However, by limiting the parameters of their investigation (to "avoid placing blame") their stated goal became impossible. Vital evidence was ignored and, even when they suspected they were being lied to, nobody was held accountable. --Continue Reading</p>

                        For instance, the trailer implies the "Radicals" are just making up an excuse to fear "the west." Is anyone so ignorant as to accept this premise? Has anyone told the producers of this film that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_ajax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Ajax</a>" is now DECLASSIFIED and admitted? (You know, where the CIA went into Iran in 1953 and, using false flag attacks, overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddeq.

                        Ten humans decide they want to start their own community, but they have no common "money" to build their economy on. A banker from a nearby town agrees to help them out. He loans each person $10 (money that he simply "prints up" in his basement) and agrees to accept "interest only" payments on the loans at a rate of 10%. (A tiny $1.00 interest payment per person, per year.)<br><br>
                        So, the new community begins with a total money supply of $100. Prices in the community are set according to this money supply and everything seems fine. At the end of the first year, the banker gathers everyone together to collect his interest. Each of the ten people surrenders their $1 "interest only" payment, but none of them stops to consider that, after making the payment, all ten of them still owe the banker $10 each. How can everyone pay their debt if the community's total money supply is now only $90? There are no longer enough dollars in circulation to pay the banker the $100 he is owed.</li>
