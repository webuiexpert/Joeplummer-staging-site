                Message boards provide an excellent opportunity to "make our case" for a new investigation. By putting
                our strongest evidence and arguments out there (and addressing common disinformation) we're providing
                all other like-minded individuals information they can use. In the end, it really isn't about the people
                we're arguing with on the board itself (although occasionally they do come around) more it's about
                everyone else. <br> <br>
                True we can't spend all our time and energy on message boards, but a post here and a post there (even if
                it's just a "cut and paste" to address a common fallacy) can have a really big effect. <br> <br>
                I spent a week addressing common arguments made against the 911 truth movement at Bill Maher's message
                board; hopefully you'll find some useful info below. (My replies appear as regular text, other posters'
                messages appear in "Quote" boxes. <br> <br>

                My reply: The only way to determine the validity of any belief is to examine the evidence that supports
                it. In the case of Americans believing Saddam was linked to 911, the "flaw" in their ability to conclude
                accurately is easily identified. It revolves around the fact they accepted an unreliable / inaccurate
                source of information (the administration and its bullhorn the Mainstream Media) to form their belief.
                <br> <br>

                Therefore it's a logical fallacy to suggest "because they drew an inaccurate conclusion regarding Saddam
                and 911, these Americans are incapable of drawing an accurate conclusion regarding the official
                account." If their beliefs are based on solid evidence (VS the baseless claims on which their Saddam /
                911 beliefs were formed) there is an excellent chance their conclusions are accurate. <br> <br>

                right through it. <br> <br>


                In keeping with my thesis; what is the evidence you have to back your claims? Is this something you've
                "heard" and accept is true? If so...what sources? <br> <br>

                Based on your statement, I'm guessing you have a fair amount of "knowledge" regarding the official
                account (as told by the government, the media, and its supporters.)

                I've literally spent years researching the "other side" of the argument. Granted; there have been a lot
                of ridiculous claims made by "conspiracy theorists." But there are also a lot of legitimate pieces of
                information that, after 5 years, have still not been adequately addressed. If you're at all interested
                in my view, this brief "1-hour guide" lays it out pretty clearly: <br> <br>

                  target="_blank">http://stopthelie.com/1-hour_guide_to_911.html</a> <br> <br>

                The essay covers more than 9/11. I'd be willing to bet (within a page or so) you'll find some
                "interesting" information. <br> <br>

                I'm going to refer to the recent popular mechanics debate with loose change. The researcher at PM said:
                <br>
                "The fact is, there are always little details that don't always add up until you finish your research.
                But when you really dig down, every single one of these has a clear explanation." <br> <br>

                So, I'll put it on you. What are 2 or 3 of your strongest pieces of evidence of a 911 conspiracy? I'll
                attempt to dig deep and see what I find. <br> <br>


                Clearly there was a "9/11 conspiracy," it's just a matter of figuring out whether or not the government
                has given us an "infallible" account of that conspiracy. <br> <br>

                The best reason we have for doubting the accuracy of the official account is the source of that account
                itself. (That is to say: The same source that linked Saddam to 911, to OBL, to the anthrax attacks, and
                to WMD; the same source that has been "wrong" about innumerable other claims presented as "fact.") Call
                me crazy, but I'm distrustful of any individual or institution that gives me inaccurate or misleading
                information on a regular basis. (Yes, this includes those who claim to be involved in the "911 Truth
                Movement.") <br>

                As far as evidence goes (that the government is lying) the body of evidence is "greater than the sum of
                its parts." From a string of implausible "intelligence failures" that permitted the attacks, to the fact
                nobody was ever held accountable for negligence and some were actually promoted. From the
                administrations deliberate attempt to derail an investigation; to the way in which the shoe-string
                "Commission" was eventually assembled and directed. From being told repeatedly "nobody could have ever
                imagined this" to the fact military drills mimicking precisely a 9/11 style attack (Jets as weapons
                flown into the WTC) were conducted years prior to the actual event. Moreover, multiple drills of this
                type were being run on 9/11 itself. -but we're to accept it was "never imagined." <br> <br>

                Each of these pieces paint a clear picture of deception and we need to get to the bottom of why. There
                could be many reasons I suppose, but when you look at how the attacks have been used to completely
                transform foreign and domestic policy; it would be foolish to ignore the worst case scenario. If you
                research the history of state sponsored "false-flag terrorism," the absurdity of NOT considering all the
                angles becomes even more apparent. <br> <br>

                I've noticed many have held up Popular Mechanics as a reliable source for debunking "911 myths." I wish
                it were true. If their explanations were as simple and clear cut as they'd have us believe, all I'd have
                to worry about is the way in which 911 has been used to further an already established (and otherwise
                impossible) military agenda. <br> <br>

                This interview shows the vulnerability of some of their assertions. <br> <br>

                One of these days I am going to write an essay listing the similarities between the 9/11 Truth Movement
                and Creationism, but here is one logical fallacy that is commonly committed by both: the <a
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biased_sample" target="_blank">biased sample</a>. <br> <br>

                The Intelligent Design movement, which is a vast PR campaign dedicated to constructing the illusion that
                creationism is a legitimate scientific theory, often cite a list of scientists who have signed a
                petition against Darwin's theory of evolution. Aside from the fact that very few of these scientists are
                actually biologists, the ID press releases also neglect to mention that the people who have signed this
                statement represent far less than one percent of the scientific community. In fact, you will seldom hear
                them even address the existence of the latter; in order to make their unscientific views seem
                legitimate, they must reinforce the illusion that the scientists who agree with them are the only
                scientists who exist. <br> <br>

                The 9/11 Truth Movement employs the same tactic. They will trumpet the account of one dissenting
                professor as proof that the widely accepted reasons for the WTC collapses defy the laws of physics, but
                they conveniently neglect to mention that to the vast majority of physicists, architects, structural
                engineers, etc., the towers fell down exactly as they should have without the need for explosives,
                missiles, or a Jewish earthquake machine. The cherrypicked expert is a vital tool for making it seem
                like the conspiracy theorists have science on their side despite the fact that almost none of them have
                any training in any of the relevant fields. <br> <br>

                Both groups lie on the fringe of scientific thought, and as such, both must resort to fallacies such as
                the biased sample in order to make their pseudoscience look like science. <br> <br>


                I've already spent too much time here today; a few quick points: <br> <br>

                1. I feel it's disingenuous to imply the government doesn't engage in "cherry-picked" information or
                "biased samples." To the contrary, those employed by the government have a vested interest (a bias) for
                staying within the parameters set by their superiors. On the other side, many who've come forward
                against the official account had no vested interest (save perhaps a bias for the truth.) Many would
                argue their bias has COST them rather than provide security and advancement. <br> <br>

                2. Given your analysis, all of Galileo's observations must have been irrelevant. After all, what
                "percentage of the scientific community" would have openly backed his assertion that the earth was not
                the center of the universe and our planet (god forbid) actually revolved around the sun? AGAIN; The only
                way to determine the validity of a belief is to examine the evidence that supports it. The fact many
                people believe something does not necessarily indicate accuracy (or lack of accuracy.) Only the evidence
                can do that. <br> <br>

                3. Nobody is implying the Scholars for 911 Truth are the "only scientists who exist." Honestly, I don't
                understand the premise of your argument. Does the government point to the Scholars website to support
                its assertions? Why would the 9/11 Truth Movement use "Official Theory" scientists as a reference for
                making their point? (-Except maybe to show holes in the official account.) <br> <br>

                And although I've already covered the "vast majority" argument in point 2; what do you consider the
                "vast majority?" Where is this enormous sea of experts? And why, out of all those people, have none
                stepped forward to debate their facts in a public forum? <br><br>

                Steven Jones' paper regarding the collapse of the Towers and WTC7 has been peer-reviewed multiple times.
                So, let's have another scientist (with an alternate peer-reviewed theory) debate him. Show us where he's
                wrong. If there was no molten metal, explain the confusion and the debris that suggests otherwise. If
                there was no thermite; show us where Jones messed up. Explain how "compressed air" bypassed the path of
                least resistance to blow out windows 20 stories below the collapse point. It can't be that hard. Let's
                put it all to rest. Let's give people both sides instead of insisting they blindly accept as "gospel"
                what the government has told them. <br> <br>

                ...and let's do it on Bill's show. I guarantee HBO would pick up some subscribers. <br> <br>

                However, does the fact that Dick Cheney cherrypicked sources to lead us into a disasterous war with Iraq
                make it OK when you guys do it to support the controlled demolition theory? <br> <br>


                What have I "cherry-picked?" That the fires were nowhere near hot enough to melt steel? That isn't in
                dispute. And yet there is molten metal in the basement of all three buildings. What is it and what
                caused it? (Backed by evidence, not just speculation.) <br> <br>

                That none of the core columns showed evidence of reaching even 500 degrees Fahrenheit? That comes
                straight from NIST. <br> <br>

                That fireman and police (many ex-military) IN THE BUILDINGS and on the scene reported bombs going off?
                -Some saying they were actually knocked off their feet by explosions. I'm supposed to dismiss that
                testimony out of hand because a talking head (in his ivory tower with an agenda) says their testimony is
                irrelevant? <br> <br>

                My immediate thoughts regarding the "controlled demolition controversy:" <br> <br>

                Why weren't explosives the first thing considered as the cause for the WTC buildings' collapse?
                Terrorists regularly use bombs to attack their targets, countless reputable eyewitnesses reported bombs
                going off, buildings have never collapsed in the manner witnessed on 9/11 without the help of
                explosives, and in 1993 explosives were successfully placed (by terrorists) and detonated in one of the
                same buildings that fell on 9/11! To have the government bend itself into an intellectual pretzel to
                make their "fire initiated collapse" theory stick (without spending any time looking into the more
                plausible theory) makes no sense whatsoever. <br> <br>


                Is anyone saying WTC7 COULD NOT have been a controlled demolition because it is physically impossible?
                Are there any experts foolish enough to suggest that? If not, then all of the resistance revolves around
                this: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE absent inside help. My, my, my; that is a touchy subject. But one
                that ought to be explored none the less. <br> <br>

                It's odd how you claim the "vast majority of experts" agree on this when even NIST (after 5 years) has
                begun to look at the controlled demolition theory. Why would they do this if they're all in agreement on
                what happened? Is it maybe because their "best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence?"

                come from The Man tends not to affect the conclusions scientist reach; rather, there is a very strict
                set of tests that any theory must pass in order to be considered legitimate. <br> <br>


                I suppose it depends on the "scientists" involved and the study. I'd have to look at the specifics. In
                this case: Yes, I think there is pressure. <br> <br>

                thing about the controlled demolition theory is that it is granted next to no legitimacy by experts in

                The "thing about Galileo" is he wasn't granted any legitimacy by experts in relevant fields; but over

                his more controversial points were proven true. The "thing about the controlled demolition theory" is
                that it hasn't been adequately debated and for some reason people like you appear dead set against
                letting others see and judge the evidence for themselves. It's ironic you denounce the regime for only
                telling "one-side" of the story as it applied to Iraq, but you fully defend its tactics on an even more
                important issue. (The possibility 9/11 might have actually involved more than 19 Arab hijackers

                collapse is very much like saying that every biologist is wrong about evolution except for the handful
                who signed a statement disagreeing with it. <br> <br>


                There you go again, trying to tie two completely different issues together and talking about "vast
                majorities." <br> <br>

                First: The 9/11 Truth Movement is nothing like the Intelligent Design movement. Video, Audio, hard
                physical evidence and living eyewitnesses are available to back up all arguments. To the best of my
                knowledge, the Intelligent Design movement has none of these. <br> <br>

                Second, you keep drifting back into how important the "vast majority" is. Didn't we cover that already?
                (Repeatedly?) <br> <br>

                Just for fun, why don't you compile a list of that "vast majority of experts?" See if any of them are
                willing to sign off on this statement: "Based on my observation of the collapse of buildings 1, 2, and
                7, it is my belief controlled demolition is a physical impossibility." <br> <br>

                Once you do that; I'll take your list of zero names and compare it to my own list. The statement: "Based
                on my observation of the collapse of buildings 1, 2, and 7, it is my belief the government's theories
                are provably false." <br>

                We're not talking about evolution VS creationism. (Focus, Focus, Focus.) What we're talking about is
                whether or not the government has told us "the truth and nothing but the truth" regarding the events of
                9/11. The collapse of the buildings is just one of many areas that should be independently investigated.

                The government has "controlled scientific consensus" all through history for as long as possible. It

                take for global warming to be taken seriously? -and didn't the entire movement start with just a handful
                of "alarmist crackpots?" <br>

                That's all I and millions of other Americans want. Why are defenders of the official account so afraid

                How the hell is popular mechanics supposed to answer those questions? Remember, they just studied the

                weren't used in bringing down the wtc towers. The amount of expert analysis they consulted is
                staggering. <br> <br>


                Well you missed one I found particularly interesting: "How did they get the original sample of DNA

                the questions that stumped him. (I disagree with your contention they've "proven" there were no
                explosives; but that's a given.) <br> <br>

                I looked at the first PM piece and was really turned off by it. They picked a bunch of weak arguments
                (like pods, and no planes) and proceeded to paint anyone who questioned the official account as an idiot
                scumbag. It was very manipulative and slanted. Because so, I never even considered reading (let alone
                buying) their new book on the topic. (Expecting only more of the same.) <br> <br>

                I assume you've read it? I might break down and buy the God-damn thing (which will of course lead to me
                spending a month writing a rebuttal...just what I need; more time stinking up this chair.) <br> <br>

                as brian pointed out, it would make no sense to rig a building for demolition then fly a plane into

                rigged it and let explode citing the 1993 attack for groundwork in the evil plot.... <br> <br>


                It makes perfect sense when the building was designed to survive the impact of a fully loaded 707. So,
                what do I expect to happen? Exactly what I saw happen. The building was hit, some outer columns were
                severed, weight shifted to inner and outer columns and the building remained standing. EXACTLY what it
                was designed to do...exactly what one would expect. <br> <br>

                Nice try to spin that; but the evidence can more easily be used against you. I.E. <br>

                Another "theory" that has recently been put forward is debris from the North Tower cut into Building 7;
                knocking out a handful of supports on its south side. <br> <br>

                This theory also has multiple problems. First, there is little or no evidence to support it. Second, the
                North Tower literally fell on top of building 6, crushing a GIANT round hole out of the center of the
                building. Despite having a HUGE chunk ripped from it's core, the sections that weren't crushed remained
                standing and had to be brought down with explosives. <br> <br>

                Diagram of WTC complex: Note in this picture 1 WTC (The North Tower) is almost directly against building
                6 (6 WTC) whereas building 7 (7 WTC) is the farthest building away from both the North and South towers.

              <br>
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">Here is a picture of Building 6 after having the North
                Tower fall directly on it. (Note the giant hole in the center of building 6. Also highlighted: Building
                5 and the area where building 7 used to be.)</p> <br> <br>

              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">Third, and most importantly, IF the suggested damage to
                building 7 actually existed (no evidence to support the assertion) and if it were sufficient to cause
                the damaged section to collapse, we would have seen a partial collapse in the area of the damage; not a
                symmetrical vaporization straight down into the buildings own footprint. -Isn't it absurd to suggest
                that a "few key columns on the south side of building 7 might have been scooped out by falling debris,
                causing it to collapse" when in fact we can all see that building 5 suffered exactly that kind of damage
                to its south side and yet didn't collapse? Or, how about this: I wonder if some "key columns" might be
                missing from building 6...Take a close look and decide for yourself.</p> <br> <br>

              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">
                The truth, as evidenced by the pictures above (not to mention all known history) is steel framed
                buildings don't up and evaporate; even if you rip huge chunks out of them. <br> <br>

                Now, one more time, lets all have a look at building 7 (not hit by a plane or burned with jet fuel)
                disintegrate at free fall speed. <br> <br>

                But will you at least admit that you're giving stephen jones a 'free pass' on the subject of peer review

                Well, if I frame the question this way I can probably get to the answer you want: <br> <br>

                IF the government said its engineers had an irrefutable "peer-reviewed" paper that proved explosives
                could NOT have been used, and IF I heard a rumor that the referenced paper had in fact NOT been
                peer-reviewed, I would have definitely looked closer into it. In other words, I would not have accepted,
                simply because the government said so, that their engineers' paper had been peer-reviewed. <br> <br>

                I had heard the allegations against Jones' paper, but I took him at his word (assuming the allegations
                were just a continuation of the ongoing effort to discredit anyone who dares to challenge the official
                account.) <br> <br>

                As I said in my last post on this topic; if it should turn out his paper has NOT been peer-reviewed, I
                will admit I was wrong and YES it will negatively affect my trust in other things he says or has said.

                Here's a list of around 30 structural engineering papers about the wtc collapses. None of them support

                just as vulnerable to inaccurate data as anything else. Garbage in / Garbage out. <br> <br>

                Simply stated, the paper starts by building its case on fatally flawed suppositions. If the original

                (perimeter and core column temperatures) had not yet been "definitively" verified. <br> <br>

                Abstract: This paper presents a simplified approximate analysis of the overall collapse of the towers of
                World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001. The analysis shows that if prolonged heating
                caused the majority of columns of a single floor to lose their load carrying capacity, the whole tower
                was doomed. <br> <br>


                And <br>

                -by Zdenek P. Bazant <br>

                Introduction and Failure Scenario <br>

                The 110-story towers of the World Trade Center were designed to withstand as a whole the forces caused
                by a horizontal impact of a large commercial aircraft (Appendix I). So why did a total collapse occur?
                The cause was the dynamic consequence of the prolonged heating of the steel columns to very high
                temperature. The heating lowered the yield strength and caused viscoplastic (creep) buckling of the
                columns of the framed tube along the perimeter of the tower and of the columns in the building core. The
                likely scenario of failure is approximately In stage 1 (Fig. 1), the conflagration caused by the
                aircraft fuel spilled into the structure causes the steel of the columns to be exposed to sustained
                temperatures apparently exceeding 800.C. The heating is probably accelerated by a loss of the protective
                thermal insulation of steel during the initial blast. At such temperatures, structural steel suffers a
                decrease of yield strength and exhibits significant viscoplastic deformation- <br> <br>






                Already there are a couple things I can argue; for instance "prolonged heating" (south tower collapsed
                in just 56 minutes) and the repeated use of qualifiers like "if" and "apparently" to frame vital pieces
                of the argument. Most notably "the conflagration caused by the aircraft fuel spilled into the structure
                causes the steel of the columns to be exposed to sustained temperatures apparently exceeding 800
                Celsius." <br> <br>

                This is the foundation on which the rest of the paper is built. If this foundation is removed, the
                argument supported by it collapses. Granted, the author does not come right out and claim the columns
                reached 800 Celsius, but it's clearly implied. <br> <br>

                Based on the sources I've looked at, the temperatures cited are nowhere near realistic. If you have
                something else, something that contradicts the following, let me know. <br> <br>


                Regarding NISTS final analysis of the Perimeter and Core columns: <br> <br>



                Perimeter Columns: Of the more than 170 areas examined on 16 perimeter column panels, only three columns
                had evidence that the steel reached temperatures above 250 ºC <br> <br>



                Regarding the Core Columns: "their temperatures did not reach 250 ºC" <br> <br>



                Regarding All Samples: "NIST determined that there was no evidence that any of the samples had reached
                temperatures above 600 ºC" <br> <br>


                So to sum up; only three perimeter columns had evidence the steel reached 250 degrees Celsius, none of
                the enormous core columns reached even that temperature, and there was no evidence any of the samples
                had reached (let alone surpassed) 600 degrees Celsius. <br> <br>

                And you havn't commented on the fact that Jones didn't submit his paper to any structural engineers for

                I read the paper at the top of the page and responded to it. OK, you're not happy with my reply to this
                "Peer-Reviewed" paper, which one do you want me to look at? I'm not reading 30 of them tonight. <br>
                <br>

                And I can't say I understand the significance of a "peer-reviewed" paper if it can be published with so
                many suppositions. <br> <br>

                Regarding Jones, I wouldn't have a problem with him because he "didn't have his paper peer-reviewed." I
                don't need somebody else to determine what is and isn't valid for me to consider...I trust myself in
                that regard. My problem would be if he LIED and said that he had when in fact he hadn't. <br> <br>

                building collapses.
                Really... I want your take on that. Do you find it strange? <br> <br>


                No. I do not find it strange that papers have been written explaining collapse (absent explosives) if
                the parameters of their investigation DID NOT INCLUDE explosives as a possibility. <br> <br>

                Imagine you are given the following items to work with: Airplane, jet fuel, carpet, desks, miscellaneous
                office supplies, and "X" minutes of fire. Anyone can form a theory using only these items (and indeed
                many have) but that does NOT mean a more plausible theory couldn't be formed if explosives are allowed
                into the equation. <br> <br>

                So, WHY aren't they allowed into the equation? Is it because there's no evidence explosives were used?
                No. Is it because it would be physically impossible to bring a building down with explosives? No. <br>
                <br>

                It seems we're to exclude explosives only because of what their use would imply. Unlike the seemingly
                impossible task of flying a plane into the Pentagon, (over an hour after it's been determined planes are
                being hijacked, flown into buildings, and one is heading that way) the seemingly "impossible task" of
                wiring the buildings for demolition could not be explained away via "incompetence" alone. (Some inside
                assistance, presumably at a high level, would be necessary.) <br> <br>

                You'll probably just move on to the next phase of defending this man. It's becoming VERY apparant to me
                that you don't hold supporters of the conspiracy theory to the same standards that you hold supporters
                of the official story. <br> <br>


                I do not trust the government; I have good reason not to. I understand many others do not share in my
                skepticism and, as such, they parrot what they're told without scrutinizing ANY of the evidence they've
                been handed. <br> <br>

                I've admitted I took Jones at his word regarding the "peer-review" of his paper, but I've also made
                clear that a "peer-review" (or lack thereof) is not a primary concern of mine. Again, "I don't need
                somebody else to determine what is and isn't valid for me to consider..." <br> <br>

                That said; I've yet to see proof his paper doesn't qualify as "peer-reviewed" which means I've no need
                to apologize for defending his claim. <br> <br>

                You don't say? Well, why don't you dig those papers up for me and send them over. Hopefully (unlike the

                My goodness; that sounds really conclusive. Is there a list of these engineers somewhere? Any idea what

                And Jones has still not had his paper reviewed by the foremost experts, structural engineers. The fact

                That one has about 30 structural engineers listed by name that were contacted. But that was just for
                their small issue in the magazine last year.

                You missed the part about NIST considering explosives in WTC7? <br> <br>

                "NIST also is considering whether hypothetical blast events could have played a role in initiating the
                collapse. While NIST has found no evidence of a blast or controlled demolition event, NIST would like to
                determine the magnitude of hypothetical blast scenarios that could have led to the structural failure of
                one or more critical elements." <br> <br>


                And no, I didn't think you were "bluffing." I actually hoped you could send something over. <br> <br>

                I don't need a doctorate in structural engineering to know "250 degrees Celsius" is nowhere near as hot

                I guess technically 1001 structural engineers will suffice. So here is how it will work: I will wait for

                I win if either of the following two conditions are met: <br>

                1. I produce a structural engineer who believes the Towers were brought down by controlled demolition.
                <br>

                2. You are unable to provide me a complete (and current) list of 1,001 structural engineers who insist
                controlled demolition is impossible. <br>
                You waged the bet; the onus is on you. Now get started. Snap snap! <br> <br>

                like that; only religious people do. <br> <br>


                Ok, find me 1001 who accept the official account. However, don't expect me to think that means I'm
                supposed to just accept it. Steven Jones accepted the official account (until he actually looked at the

                because a bunch of experts accept a theory does NOT make it true. If their opinions are based on
                provably inaccurate or missing data, the theory is flawed. <br> <br>

                Now you keep asking me to dig up ONE structural engineer who believes the buildings were brought down

                the other we havethousands." (Which I might add is still an unsubstantiated claim) <br> <br>

                When the number grows to 10 or 20, you'll still march around with your "vast majority" argument. The
                whole exercise is a waste of time because without even ONE structural engineer I can prove your primary
                assertion wrong, I.E. just because the vast majority believes something does not make it true. <br> <br>

                How many of the greatest minds on the planet used to believe the world was flat? Or, as we've already
                covered, that the earth was the center of the universe and the sun revolved around it? How many
                centuries of "proof" were offered to support those theories? In the end, it wasn't the data given to
                support them that mattered; it was the data that was inaccurate or missing. Such is the case here. <br>
                <br>

                We're demanding a truly independent investigation of the facts surrounding ALL the anomalies of 9/11.
                And despite the best effort of people like you, we're going to get it. <br> <br>

                (on the other side of the building) would have been (IMO) the most logical target. <br> <br>

                Yes, the 767 has slightly more size and weight, but all accounts I've read indicate the 707 has a
                significantly higher cruising speed. Because of this, under normal operating conditions, the 707 would
                actually impact with more force and do more damage than a 767. Also, keep in mind, the buildings DID
                survive the impact of the planes (as they were designed to do.) <br> <br>

                This is one of the major flaws in the 911 Commission report (which is where I assume you got it from.)
                <br> <br>

                From the 911 Commission Report: "...the outside of each tower was covered by a frame of 14 inch wide
                steel columns...These exterior walls bore most of the weight of the building. The interior core of the
                buildings was a hollow steel shaft, in which elevators and stairwells were grouped." <br> <br>


                This statement is patently false. The core of the towers was not a "hollow steel shaft" but an array 47
                massive steel support columns (also commonly referred to as "core columns") which bore "most of the
                weight of the building." In the picture below, the core columns are on the left, and the outer perimeter
                columns can be seen if you look "straight ahead."
              </p> <br> <br>
              <img style="margin: 20px 0;" src="images/eeea75_2999ba5e54b2467588310bbad8836938~mv2.jpg" alt="">
              <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">
                I did a quick search and found this text. I'm sure you can verify with a little effort. <br> <br>

                "At the time of construction, most new skyscrapers were built around grid-style steel skeletons. In this
                design, the support structure is spread throughout the entire building. Metal beams are riveted end to
                end to form vertical columns, and at each floor level, these vertical columns are connected to
                horizontal girder beams. The support columns are all internal, so the outside of the building doesn't
                have to hold up anything but its own weight. These outer curtain walls can be made of just about
                anything, including ordinary glass. <br> <br>

                The WTC team took a slightly different approach. They decided to build long "tubes," where all the
                support columns would be around the outside of the building and at the central core of the
                building.Essentially, each tower was a box within a box, joined by horizontal trusses at each floor.
                <br> <br>

                The outer box, measuring 208 feet by 208 feet (63x63 m), was made up of 14-inch (36-cm) wide steel
                columns, 59 per building face, spaced just over 3 feet (1 m) apart. On every floor above the plaza
                level, the spaces between the columns housed 22-inch (56-cm) windows. Yamasaki, who had a pronounced
                fear of heights, felt that the small windows made the building feel more secure. The columns were
                covered with aluminum, giving the towers a distinctive silver color. The inner box at the core of each
                tower measured about 135 feet by 85 feet (41x26 m). Its 47 heavy steel columns surrounded a large open
                area housing elevators, stairwells and restrooms. <br> <br>

                This design had two major advantages. First of all, it gave the building remarkable stability. In
                addition to shouldering some of the vertical load (the weight of the building), the outer steel columns
                supported all of the horizontal forces acting on the tower (the force of the wind). This meant the inner
                support structure was completely dedicated to the huge vertical loads." <br> <br>
                So, if the 911 Commission (which was to provide us the "fullest possible account") goofed on something
                as basic and important as this; how can we possibly trust they've been "thorough" in the rest of their
                investigative work? <br> <br>

                Unlike the towers (which were hit by planes) there is literally NO excuse for why WTC 7 collapsed as it
                did. That is why it matters. Somebody had to prepare the building (before 911) for controlled
                demolition. Who did it? As I've speculated, if flight 93 would have flown into building 7, the already
                "wired" building wouldn't have looked so odd when it suddenly evaporating at free-fall speed. But as we
                both know, 93 didn't make its target and WTC 7 fell for a yet undetermined reason. <br> <br>

                I LOVE IT when you guys make my points for me. Note this passage from the structural engineer attacking
                Jones' work. <br> <br>

                The structural design of the towers was unique in that the supporting steel structure consisted of
                closely spaced columns in the walls of all four sides. The resulting structure was similar to a
                tube.When the aircraft impacted the towers at speeds of about 500 plus mph, many steel columns were
                immediately severed and others rendered weak by the following fires. The fires critically damaged the
                floors systems. Structural steel will begin to lose strength when heated to temperatures above 1000
                degrees Fahrenheit. Steel bridge girders are bent to conform to the curved roadway by spot heating
                flanges between 800 and 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. It is easy to comprehend the loss of carrying capacity
                of all the structural steel due to the raging fires fed by the jet's fuel as well as aircraft and
                building contents. <br> <br>

                  Able Danger and incorporate it into its findings--raises serious challenges to the commission's

                Great, so we have two things to account for: No evidence the fires reached the temperatures they keep
                throwing around (as I've covered in past posts) AND, what was the molten metal found in ALL THREE
                buildings and how did it get there? Nobody argues the fires created sufficient heat to reduce steel
                columns to a molten state-As of yet, this is the best explanation NIST has provided: <br> <br>





                NIST investigators and experts from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the Structural
                Engineers Association of New York (SEONY)-who inspected the WTC steel at the WTC site and the salvage
                yards-found no evidence that would support the melting of steel in a jet-fuel ignited fire in the towers
                prior to collapse. The condition of the steel in the wreckage of the WTC towers (i.e., whether it was in
                a molten state or not) was irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse since it does not provide any
                conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the WTC towers were standing. <br> <br>





                Translation: We know jet fuel couldn't have caused it and we know the debris burning in the buildings
                couldn't have caused it, so therefore (rather than consider if something else might have been involved -
                which doesn't fit our story) we simply deem it irrelevent. Wow, now that is what I call a quality
                investigation! <br> <br>

                So you're saying those MASSIVE core columns that supported nearly all of the towers' verticle loads

And nist estimates the fire temperature at over 1000 degrees celsius.
Did you know that their report is thousands of pages long? Just because you quote one paragraph about a couple of samples that are 250 degrees, doesn't mean that that was their final conclusion. Go ahead, read through it. Look into HOW MUCH EVIDENCE THEY HAVE FOR 1000 DEGREES TEMPERATURES.

Nice try. I was not talking about the heat of the fires, I was talking about the temperatures reached by the actual steel support columns. Somehow I think you know that.  <br> <br>

Far less important than the "estimated" heat of the fires is the actual temperature of the support columns; their temperature is what would determine the loss of structural integrity. And for that most important piece of evidence; they've got nothing approaching their estimates. <br> <br>

The core columns went all the way down through the buildings. I honestly can't believe you're saying that blowing the core columns wouldn't affect the load bearing capacity of the structure. If that is true, why bother having them in the first place? Better yet, see if you can find a structural engineer who'll back you up on that. <br> <br>

Those basement bombs SURE WERE IMPORTANT. WERN'T THEY? The floors directly above it remained intact.
Your position is utterly absurd. <br> <br>


Man, I'm really starting to feel sorry for you. -Seriously. If the "base of the towers were left standing" do you really think only a handful of people would have been pulled from the wreckage?  <br> <br>

More importantly, given your logic, the 13th floor must have remained standing since people who were on the 13th floor survived the collapse. Wait; let me see if I can word it properly: <br> <br>

 

 

"If the towers actually crumbled to the ground as you suggest, how exactly did people who were on the 13th floor survive? I mean, that whole "complete disintegration" thing sure wasn't very important was it??? People right in the middle of it managed to survive being crushed under hundreds of millions of pounds of debris. Your position is utterly absurd-" <br> <br>

 

 

Sarcasm aside; I could explain how people on the ground level of building collapses sometimes are lucky enough to get caught in "pockets" (as debris "stacks up" surrounding the collapse site) and how in the case of the towers there were ACTUALLY survivors from the 13th floor stairwell. -but forget it. 

You've got your mind made up that everything the government has told you is true, and I've got mine made up that too many pieces of information were ignored or distorted to fit the "story" they sold the American people. 

Look at the bright side; you're perfectly content with the official account and I'm not. That means I've got to push, shove, argue, and fight to get what I want-all you've got to do is sit back and throw mud. <br> <br>

 

 

 

I'd love to see a simple experiment with a steel framed building that has been marked for demolition. <br> <br>

The government contends fire started the "collapse event" in the towers, but then does nothing to explain the mechanics of what happened next. (We can assume their position is: Total collapse was inevitable once the upper floors started moving.)  <br> <br>

So, here is the experiment: <br> <br>

1. Find a steel framed building; we'll assume 50 stories high <br>
2. Blow out the support of 3 floors (lets say floors 37, 38, & 39)  <br>
3. See what happens.  <br>
 <br> <br>

 

This experiment oughta end all the speculation about how the lower / heavier (stronger) portion of a steel framed building reacts when it's hit with a much smaller, lighter, and weaker "upper section." <br> <br>

 

If you had to bet a year's pay, would you bet "for" or "against" a repeat of what we saw on 9/11. <br> <br>

Ya, sounds crazy don't it? Anyone who believes our own government would consider doing something like that must lack "critical thinking skills." Well that or maybe they've seen evidence you haven't.  <br> <br>

Now, I'm not saying planes were swapped or drones were used, but to suggest (as you're doing) that it's beyond something our government would consider is provably WRONG. <br> <br> 

Read the northwoods document and you'll learn (apparently for the first time) how truly "crazy" and sinister these people can be...The Northwoods Plan went all the way to the top...through all the Joint Chiefs straight to the President's desk.  <br> <br>

What do one of the "pretexts to justify military action" call for? Fake passengers, dummy planes, fake mayday calls, and yes, BLOWING UP remote controlled drones at sea. Don't believe me? Go to The National Security Archive andREAD the damn thing. <br> <br>

 

Better yet, this comes straight from that particular section: <br> <br>

 

"It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama, or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non-scheduled flight. <br> <br>

 

a. An aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time, the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would beconverted to a drone. <br> <br>

 

 

b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin Air Force Base where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will being transmitting on the international distress frequency a "May Day" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the USUS trying to "sell" the incident." what has happened to the aircraft instead of the <br> <br>

 

The black ops arm of our government is anything BUT "incompetent." Using lies, deception and yes FALSE FLAG TERRORISM, they've overthrown and controlled countless governments (and manipulated countless populations) for hundreds of years." With a little effort on your part, you can verify every word of it. <br> <br>

i suppose you think it's no accident that the document was published online in april 2001, just 5 months before 9/11?[/ <br> <br>


My interpretation: <br> <br>

1. PoetryChic already knows about Northwoods, so she knows a covert operation involving fake planes, fake passengers, remote control drone aircraft, faked mayday calls and a simulated "shoot down" (using explosives) was approved all the way up to the President of the United States. Therefore, poetrychic is being disingenuous when she implies only "crazy conspiracy theorists" dream up such elaborate and truly insane plots. <br> <br> 

2. Poetrychic "knows" that Dulles, Cabell, Bissell and Lemnitzer were all dismissed because of Operation Northwoods (as opposed to being dismissed because of the Bay of Pigs disaster - the commonly accepted reason for dismissing Dulles, Cabell and Bissell.) Still, we're left with Lemnitzer, so let's test what remains of her theory on him:  <br> <br>

If Lemnitzer was being punished by our government for conspiring to carry out false flag terror operations, why would he be appointed "Supreme Allied Commander" of NATO? Are you familiar with Operation Gladio? Seems to me, Supreme Allied Commander of NATO would have been the perfect place for a man like Lemnitzer. -Hardly a demotion; his new post provided the opportunity to "fight commies" exactly the way he wanted. I.E. using false flag terror operations.  <br> <br>

3. Poetrychic seems to have an agenda. Unfortunately, she relies heavily on insinuation and snide remarks to make her case. Her case, best I can tell, is little more than this: She is certain 19 Arab hijackers commanded by a man in a cave were the sole perpetrators of 9/11. She knows this because her government told her so. Anyone who considers the possibility of covert / black op elements being involved in 9/11 is clearly a nut job.  <br> <br>

What's so sad is I used to think Poetrychic was simply ignorant of history. I thought she, like so many Americans, didn't know how elements of our government have used terrorism, assassinations, torture, death squads and false flag operations to achieve their objectives. <br> <br>

One question: Which is a greater threat to the future of this country?  <br> <br>

1. Seriously investigating ALL the evidence (and possibilities) surrounding the events of 9/11 and finding nothing wrong. (This WILL BE the outcome if poetrychic is right.)  <br> <br>

2. Ignoring all the discrepancies and accepting the official account just as it is; encouraging the "types of people" who have no problem "manufacturing consent" to continue with their business as usual.  <br> <br>

In my opinion, anything that reinforces the idea false flag ops are an effective tool that carry NO RISK of scrutiny or accountability (due to people's refusal to seriously consider evidence that points in that direction) is a really dangerous message to send. <br> <br>

I never said Kennedy approved it. I said it was approved all the way UP TO the President. Nor did I say anything about how much time it would take to carry out such a mission, etc, etc, etc. So please "Do not attribute implications to me, I say what I mean and I mean what I say-" <br> <br>

These were the comments that led me to believe you were implying, as you put it, "crazy conspiracy theorists bla bla bla" <br> <br>

"as opposed to planes being landed covertly so they can be replaced with dummy planes while the original ones are flown out to sea only to be blown up..." "hmmmm, maybe that's why they killed him?)" " i suppose you think it's no accident that the document was published online in april 2001, just 5 months before 9/11?" <br> <br>

You say otherwise, but I think MOST people would have read your comments the same way I did.  <br> <br>

First you said Dulles, Cabell, Bissell and Lemnitzer were all dismissed for their role in Operation Northwoods. (I took that to mean you felt they had been "punished" for their role in the conspiracy.) I pointed out the first three were actually dismissed because of their role in the Bay of Pigs disaster.  <br> <br>

Ignoring that, you move on to defend your assertion about Lemnitzer. Let me see: Conspiracy to commit treason against the United States is "punished" by appointing Lemnitzer Supreme Allied Commander of NATO (where he can, presumably, do exactly the kind of things he's shown an interest in.) I'm sorry, that does not make sense to me. If I conspired to carry out a false flag attack against America (designed to drag our country to war) I'd expect a more legitimate "punishment."  <br> <br>

I didn't say Bin Ladin "had no power." It is an issue of whether or not he had sufficient power (or if he had ANYTHING to do with the attacks at all.) Again, being a person who is "critical" of what I'm told; I've heard over and over again that it was Bin Laden, but I've never seen convincing evidence. (And apparently, neither has the FBI.)  <br> <br>

Logical questions? Uh-Ok. Where are those again? (A little humor there-ties into the whole "snide" thing. Did you catch it?)  <br> <br>

Now, as far as "sensationalistic theories" go, I think (When you factor in all the evidence) the government's theory is just about as sensationalistic as they come. But that's just me. Well, me and apparently a bunch of other people; most notably those who were much closer to the investigation and declared it a "whitewash."  <br> <br>

A couple things. One, you keep talking about "you guys." You're generalizing. The only thing I think everyone in the "you guys" category is united on is this: A new investigation is needed. <br> <br>

Two, when you speak of a "brainwashing session" I feel you're missing the fact the government has been "washing brains" regarding this event for five years now. Everything you "know" (about the dna, about the collapse of the buildings, about the hijackers, the "intelligence failures" etc.) began as information provided by the government. Contrary to what you're asserting, we ARE "pausing to ask questions" about these things. However, if the answers cannot survive the evidence, we aren't going to accept them. The only "theory" I'm certain of is we didn't get the full story regarding the events of 9/11. And that theory certainly doesn't "hover outside the realm of logic."  <br> <br>

I can (and have) pointed out "factual errors" in statements you've made about things that could have easily been researched / verified. In my case, I was wrong to assume you were ignorant of how truly sinister and competent the covert / black ops arm of our government is. -hardly the same. Besides, I was trying to give you (in my own mind) the benefit of the doubt. It's hard for most people to imagine "government complicity" outside the lesser known historical context.  <br> <br>

What are you talking about? I can only assume you mean these words: "terrorism, assassinations, torture, death squads and false flag operations." <br> <br>

Do you have better words to describe these activities? Would you prefer: "intentionally killing innocent civilians, extrajudicial executions, medieval coercion tactics, organizing and funding lawless murderers, and blaming atrocities (committed by your own organization) on others?" I'm open to suggestions, but I think the words I originally used were pretty good.  <br> <br>

And what you casually dismiss as "talking points" I consider vitally important information. (Historical facts that help balance people's perception of what "our government" is and isn't capable of.) <br> <br>

Well, I had asked "What poses the greater threat" not the "greatest threat" (there is a big difference) but I must admit I'm in general agreement with your statement above.  <br> <br>

It doesn't make any sense to answer questions like "How did they run miles of demolition wire without anyone seeing them?" I mean, I can speculate. I can say: "Who says they couldn't have used wireless technology?" Or, "Were the inner support structures exposed? If not, how would anyone notice anything?" Or maybe I'd ask "Who was in charge of security; is it possible that could have played a role?"  <br> <br>

The problem with all these replies is they can't be proven without a legitimate investigation. They also skip over the one thing we CAN prove: The official account of how the towers collapsed is based on incomplete and speculative data. And five years later, the government still hasn't explained the collapse of building 7. In my mind, the logical order is to deal with those issues first. They, if properly dealt with, will lead us to the rest. <br> <br>

And you think I'm asking you to? <br> <br>

Seeing as that you've stated on numerous occasions you believe the government might have "let it happen" (and assuming you find that unacceptable) it would seem we're in agreement on the most important part of all this. (A new investigation is needed.) <br> <br>

The only thing we disagree on is how much criminal complicity the investigation might reveal. <br> <br>

if the goal of the day was for the government to attack civilians and stage a terrorist attack and the wtc towers were rigged with explosives why would they allow them to stand for so long after the initial impacts? and why bother using planes at all? (precedent for a bomb in the buildings was already set in 1993...planes seem a bit like overkill) <br> <br>

Again, it requires speculation. But not so hard to imagine is the "effect" of terrorizing the American people. After all; far more Americans travel by airplane than visit "high priority terrorist targets" like the world trade center. And with that said, (using "airport security") there is the added benefit of being able to keep millions of people in a state of perpetual fear; reinforcing every day that there is a threat so grave they'd better get used to being treated like a potential terrorist themselves. <br> <br>

Think about that for a minute: Assuming you believe the official account (Terrorists gained access to the cockpits and took control of the planes) the ONLY WAY to guarantee that never happened again would be to make the cockpit doors impassable and arm the pilots. With that done, we wouldn't have to worry about multiple planes being hijacked using box-cutters (or nail clippers for that matter) ever again. But instead, a billion man hours are wasted every year as people stand in line for a "security measure" that has proven all but worthless in testing. <br> <br>

Again: <br>

Option one prevents a similar attack from ever happening again, violates no civil liberties, and does not create a climate of fear. <br> <br>

Option two cannot stop a similar incident from happening, wastes a billion man hours annually, trains people to accept living as suspects, and perpetuates a climate of fear. <br> <br>

Why would they choose option two? Is it because it's the more beneficial option for you and I or the more beneficial option for them? <br> <br>

As far as the precedent of "bombs in the buildings," I brought that up in my "1-hour guide" as one of the most logical reasons why "bombs" should have been the main focus from the beginning. (Instead, it took 5 years for them to finally include explosives as a possibility in building 7.) <br> <br>

Why not demolish the buildings immediately following the impacts? My speculation: The buildings were built to withstand the impact of a 707. I think they needed "fire" to help sell the collapse. After all the reality is: the buildings DID survive the initial impacts. Contrary to what others have argued, many engineers would have expected exactly that.
