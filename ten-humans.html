  <h1>ADDENDUM<br>Ten Humans and a Banker</h1>
</div>

<div class="Chapter-content">

          <p>Ten humans decide they want to start their own community, but they have no common "money" to build their
            economy on. A banker from a nearby town agrees to help them out. He loans each person $10 (money that he
            simply prints up in his basement) and agrees to accept interest-only payments on the loans at a rate of 10%.
            (A tiny $1.00 interest payment per person, per year.)</p>

          <p>So, the new community begins with a total money supply of $100. Prices in the community are set according
            to this money supply, and everything seems fine.</p>

          <p>At the end of the first year, the banker gathers everyone together to collect his interest. Each of the 10
            people surrenders their $1 interest-only payment, but none of them stops to consider that, after making the
            payment, all ten of them still owe the banker $10 each. How can everyone pay their debt if the community's
            total money supply is now only $90? There are no longer enough dollars in circulation to pay the banker the
            $100 he is owed.</p>

          <div class="side-note">
            <p><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> The banker <em>could</em> spend the $10 worth of interest payments back into
              the economy, and this would raise the community's money supply back to $100, but he won't do that. For
              now, the people will be left with only $90 to pay $100 in debt.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Although the common people might not have figured out their debt predicament, they <em>have</em> noticed
            that getting a "fair price" for their products and services seems a little tougher than the year before.
            Prices seem to be dropping. But the banker understands why. He knows that there are fewer dollars in
            circulation, and this raises the value, or purchasing power, of each dollar.</p>

          <p>As the value of each dollar goes up, the number of dollars a customer is willing to pay (in exchange for
            another person's products or services) goes down.</p>

          <p>By the end of the second year, one of the borrowers (a successful businessman who has managed to accumulate
            $15) makes his interest payment <em>and</em> pays off his debt in full. So, as everyone else makes their
            second $1.00 interest-only payment, he pays both the interest due and the $10 he originally borrowed. This
            reduces the community's total money supply by another $20 ($10 in interest payments plus the businessman's
            $10 principal payment).</p>

          <p>There are now only $70 (to be shared by all 10 people in the community), and nine people still owe the
            banker the full $10 ($90 in total debt).</p>

          <p>Two more years pass, and two more people manage to earn enough to pay off their debts. So, by the end of
            the fourth year, the money supply is reduced by another $38 ($18 in "interest" payments plus another $20
            from the two individuals who, despite the difficulty, earned enough from the shrinking money supply to pay
            off their loans).</p>

          <p>There is now only $32 left in the community to be shared among all 10 people â€” and seven of those people
            still owe the banker $10 each ($70 total).</p>

          <p>At this point, it will be nearly impossible for those who are still in debt to make their $1.00 interest
            payments, let alone pay off their debt. (Where once there was $10 for each person in the community, there is
            now only $3.20.) With so few dollars left in circulation, the purchasing power of each dollar has gone
            through the roof.</p>

          <p>Prices have fallen drastically, and the economy is in shambles. If the banker does not help the people out
            (by putting more money back into the community), bankruptcies are inevitable. Bank seizure of property is
            inevitable. Financial ruin is inevitable.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

          <p>The businessman (who paid his debt off first) approaches the banker. He explains to the banker that the
            people <em>want</em> to work; it's just that times are tough. At its height, his business employed half the
            town. Now, he is down to just a couple employees, and he has had to cut their pay. He just can't afford the
            $2.00 per year salary anymore, and even at that rate, half of their pay is being eaten up by their annual
            interest payment. They can barely feed themselves!</p>

          <p>He points out, if the banker agrees to fund a new/ambitious project, the town will spring to life. There
            will be jobs for all, and the suffering will end. But he also points out, without the project, many people
            are likely to default on their loans. The businessman just doesn't see how the people will be able to
            continue making their payments in such a depressed economy. "Please, Mr. Banker," he says, "You've got to
            help us out."</p>

          <p>The banker agrees to the loan, and it's a whopper ($100). The businessman is ecstatic. Shaking the banker's
            hand, he promises to make good on the loan. He's not only certain his new venture will be profitable, he's
            certain the whole town will benefit. "Oh, thank you, Mr. Banker," he says sincerely, "You have done a good
            thing here!"</p>

          <p>But nobody stops to think that there is now $132.00 in the economy to cover $170.00 of debt. And each year,
            $10 in interest will be due on the new $100 loan, and $7 will be due on the $70 that was unpaid from before.
            The banker knows the math, and with a smile, he creates the $100 out of thin air, and the cycle starts over.
          </p>

          <p>Welcome to the debt-based monetary system. Whether it is a small community or a powerful nation, any
            economy built on this fraudulent system is doomed. Its debt is mathematically inescapable, and if the people
            start paying down their debts (or if the banks simply refuse to renew loans), the money supply will
            evaporate, and financial ruin will follow.</p>

          <p>When the federal government talks about paying off the national debt, it is <em>lying</em> to you. It
            cannot do this without destroying our economy. The bankers that created our Federal Reserve Bank in 1913
            built "dependency" into the system. It was designed to create ever-expanding, inescapable debt. And at the
            national level, that means ever-expanding <em>control</em> over the political and bureaucratic institutions
            that feed, and depend on, dishonest money.</p>

            <p>[1] Again, the banker could technically spend <em>all</em> of the interest he has collected back into
              the economy to ease the pressure (quite a deal for him since the dollars he has "earned" will now be worth
              a small fortune), but this does not change the fact that the debt is inescapable. As the debts are paid,
              the money supply shrinks. Without new loans (new debt), the economy will grind to a halt, and those still
              holding debt will have no choice but default. <a href="#fnref1">â†©</a></p>
