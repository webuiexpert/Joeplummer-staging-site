                    <p>
                        If you have ever watched an illusionist perform up-close magic, you know the power of
                        misdirection and
                        sleight-of-hand. Even in a room full of suspicious and attentive observers, the illusionist can
                        fool them
                        all.
                        By exploiting known weaknesses in the human mind and employing his tools of the trade, he will
                        deceive the
                        crowd whether it wants to be deceived or not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Imagine what an equally talented "network" of political illusionists can accomplish. Performing
                        before an
                        audience of mostly trusting and casual observers, exploiting known weaknesses in the human mind,
                        and
                        employing
                        their tools of the trade, they, too, will deceive the crowd whether it wants to be deceived or
                        not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Having spent nearly sixty years of my life researching and writing about the illusionists who
                        control our
                        world, I can say without reservation that you are about to learn some of their closest-held
                        secrets. Joe has
                        done an outstanding job of weeding through Carroll Quigley's book, <em>Tragedy &amp; Hope</em>.
                        He has
                        captured the essence of what Quigley referred to as "the Network" and made this important
                        information
                        accessible to the average person who simply doesn't have time to read a 1,300-page history book.
                        Even for
                        those who intend to read the entire volume, Joe has created an introduction and study guide that
                        will serve
                        the serious student well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Knowledge of who Carroll Quigley was and the deceptions that he revealed is essential for
                        understanding the
                        real world of today. His close relationship with the Network and his approval of its aims made
                        it possible
                        to
                        provide an insider's analysis of the minds and methods of the global elite. Without this
                        knowledge, the
                        actions of those who dominate the U.S. government and the Western world do not make sense. With
                        it,
                        everything
                        falls into place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Be forewarned. The journey you are about to begin is not for the faint-hearted. If you are
                        comfortable with
                        the illusions that currently pass for political reality, this book is not for you because, once
                        you discover
                        how the deceivers perform their magic, the comfort of ignorance is no longer possible. Once the
                        bell is
                        rung,
                        it cannot be unrung.
                    </p>

                    <p>The bell starts ringing on the next page.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever felt like democracy is just an illusion? Have you ever suspected that there are
                        very "powerful people" who've created a system that <em>appears</em> to be democratic, but
                        actually cuts ordinary citizens out of the decision-making process? Have you ever wondered: "Who
                        is really running things, and what exactly are they trying to achieve?" If you have, you're not
                        alone.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, a Harvard-educated history professor named Carroll Quigley wrote a handful of books
                        that answer all of these questions and more. Unfortunately, the answers are very disturbing,
                        especially to those who've accepted the common myths of "democratic government."</p>

                    <p>In Quigley's work we discover that national constitutions are routinely undermined by the leaders
                        who are elected to defend them. We learn that "all social instruments tend to become
                        institutions," regardless of their benevolent origin, and, from that point forward, the
                        <em>institution</em> is run for the benefit of those who control it (at the expense of its
                        original purpose).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>Perhaps most unsettling, Quigley reveals that real power operates behind the scenes, in secrecy,
                        and with little to fear from so-called democratic elections. He proves that conspiracies, secret
                        societies, and small, powerful networks of individuals are not only real; they're extremely
                        effective at creating or destroying entire nations and shaping the world as a whole. We learn
                        that "representative government" is, at best, a carefully managed con game.</p>

                    <p>Since these disturbing truths contradict nearly everything our government, education system, and
                        media have taught us to believe, many will immediately dismiss them as nonsense. "Only wild-eyed
                        conspiracy theorists believe such things," they will say. However, there is one big problem:
                        Carroll Quigley was no wild-eyed conspiracy theorist. Quite the contrary, Quigley was a
                        prominent historian who specialized in studying the evolution of civilizations as well as secret
                        societies. He studied history at Harvard University, where he earned his bachelor's, master's,
                        and PhD degrees. He taught at Princeton University, Harvard University, and the School of
                        Foreign Service at Georgetown University. He worked as an advisor to the US Defense Department,
                        the US Navy, and the Smithsonian Institution.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>In short, Carroll Quigley was a well-connected and well-credentialed member of Ivy League
                        society. Based on his own words, and his training as a historian, it appears that he was chosen
                        by members of a secret network to write the real history of their rise to power. However, as
                        Quigley later realized, these individuals did not expect or intend for him to publish their
                        secrets for the rest of the world to see. Shortly after publishing <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> in
                        1966, "the Network" apparently made its displeasure known to Quigley's publisher, and the book
                        he'd spent twenty years writing was pulled from the market. As Quigley recounts:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The original edition published by Macmillan in 1966 sold about 8800 copies and sales were

                            after them with a lawyer, they told me that they had destroyed the plates in 1968). They
                            lied to me for six years, telling me that they would re-print when they got 2000 orders,
                            which could never happen because they told anyone who asked that it was out of print and
                            would not be reprinted. They denied this until I sent them Xerox copies of such replies to
                            libraries, at which they told me it was a clerk's error. In other words they lied to me but
                            prevented me from regaining the publication rights by doing so. [Rights revert back to the

                    <h2>A Book like No Other</h2>

                    <p>If you decide to read <em>Tragedy and Hope,</em> the first thing you're likely to notice is its
                        size. At over thirteen hundred pages, approximately six hundred thousand words, and weighing in
                        around five pounds, it's safe to say that it wasn't written for the casual reader. Nor was it
                        written like a novel, bursting with scandalous and interesting conspiratorial tidbits on every
                        page. Rather, as one would expect from an Ivy League historian, it is a long and often tedious
                        read of which 95 percent consists of basic economic, political, and diplomatic history. However,
                        within the other 5 percent, you'll find some truly astonishing admissions about the existence,
                        nature, and effectiveness of covert power.</p>

                    <p>In both <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> and <em>The Anglo-American Establishment</em>, Quigley reveals
                        the existence of a secret network that formed to bring "all the habitable portions of the world"
                        under its control.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>

                                and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret
                                records</strong>. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of
                            my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past
                            and recently, to a few of its policies…but in general my chief difference of opinion is that
                            <strong>it wishes to remain unknown</strong>, and I believe its role in history is
                            significant enough to be known.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a>

                    <p>Quigley informs us that this wealthy "Anglophile network" cooperates with <em>any</em> group that
                        can help it achieve its goal.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote">[6]</a> (This includes
                        Communists, which, on the surface, would seem to be the sworn enemy of super-wealthy capitalist
                        conspirators.) He chronicles how the Network formed in the late 1800s in England and immediately
                        began creating front groups. By 1919, it had formed the Royal Institute of International Affairs
                        (also known as Chatham House), and it went on to create other extremely powerful institutes
                        within "the chief British dominions and in the United States."<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7"
                            class="footnote">[7]</a> Hiding behind these front groups, the Network began secretly
                        exercising its power.</p>

                    <p>In the United States the main institute was named the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which
                        Quigley described as "a front for J. P. Morgan and company."<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"

                            structure between London and New York which penetrated deeply into university life, the
                            press, and the practice of foreign policy. In England, the center was the Round Table Group,
                            while in the United States it was J. P. Morgan and Company or its local branches in Boston,
                            Philadelphia, and Cleveland.</p>

                        <p>The American branch of this "English Establishment" exerted much of its influence through
                            five American newspapers (<em>The New York Times</em>, New York <em>Herald Tribune</em>,
                            <em>Christian Science Monitor</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the lamented
                            <em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>). In fact, the editor of the <em>Christian Science
                                Monitor</em> was the chief American correspondent (anonymously)…It might be mentioned
                            that the existence of this Wall Street, Anglo-American axis is quite obvious once it is
                            pointed out.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a>

                    <p>If the idea of powerful Wall Street insiders joining a secret foreign network to establish
                        dominion over all "habitable portions of the world" and successfully penetrating "into
                        university life, the press, and the practice of foreign policy" sounds like something you should
                        have heard about, you're right. But the secret to why you haven't is contained in the story
                        itself. (The successful "penetration" of universities, the press, and the government has proven
                        quite useful to those who wish "to remain unknown.")</p>

                    <h2>The Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR)</h2>

                    <p>Quigley provides many examples of Network infiltration and manipulation. For instance, on pages
                        132 and 953 of <em>Tragedy and Hope, </em>he exposes yet another "front group" called the
                        Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). Because the IPR provides priceless insight into the
                        deceptive nature and true power of the Network, we'll briefly cover it here. Let's begin with
                        the final report of a US Senate investigation of the IPR. It stated, in part:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The IPR has been considered by the American Communist Party and by Soviet officials as an
                            instrument of Communist policy, propaganda and military intelligence. The IPR disseminated
                            and sought to popularize false information including information originating from Soviet and
                            Communist sources…<strong>The IPR was a vehicle used by the Communists to orient American
                                far eastern policies toward Communist objectives.</strong><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11"
                                class="footnote">[11]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>To the average person, it sounds crazy to suggest that a network of super-wealthy
                        <em>capitalists</em> is secretly conspiring to gain control of the world. But it sounds even
                        crazier to accuse these same super-wealthy capitalists of using their tremendous wealth and
                        power to popularize a system of government (Communism) that would, in <em>theory</em> anyway,
                        lead to the destruction of all their wealth and power. Surely, if such an unbelievable story
                        were true, the free press would have shouted it from the rooftops…right? Wrong. Let's jump ahead
                        for just a second and look at how Quigley described the Network-directed media cover up of the
                        Senate investigation:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It soon became clear that people of immense wealth would be unhappy if the investigation went
                            too far and that the "most respected" newspapers in the country, closely allied with these
                            men of wealth, would not get excited enough about any [revelations] to make the publicity
                            worth while, in terms of votes or campaign contributions.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12"
                                class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As this demonstrates, the Network fully understands the importance of controlling public opinion.
                        This also provides a glimpse into how it can do so. (If a disturbing truth isn't reported on by
                        a "respected" news outlet, it might as well not exist. The vast majority of citizens will remain
                        forever oblivious.) Additionally, in this particular case, any senator that insisted on taking
                        the investigation "too far" would surely face a smear campaign by the same press that was
                        ignoring the IPR story. Shortly thereafter, the "people of immense wealth" who ordered the smear
                        campaign could be counted on to retaliate financially as well; by shifting all future campaign
                        contributions to a more obedient candidate.</p>

                    <p>Needless to say, this type of <em>influence</em> can drastically affect how much attention an
                        issue receives in the media. The merit and importance of a story will often take a backseat to
                        the wishes of those who have the power to keep it quiet. More importantly, similar tactics of
                        control can be applied in other areas as well. Keep that in mind as you read the following short
                        summary of the IPR's activities, because the blueprint for directing perception and policies
                        hasn't changed.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In 1951 the Subcommittee on Internal Security of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the
                            so-called McCarran Committee, sought to show that China had been lost to the Communists by
                            the deliberate actions of a group of academic experts on the Far East and Communist fellow
                            travelers whose work in that direction was controlled and coordinated by the Institute of
                            Pacific Relations (IPR). <strong>The influence of the Communists in IPR is well established,
                                but the patronage of Wall Street is less well known.</strong></p>

                        <p>The headquarters of the IPR and of the American Council of IPR were both in New York and were
                            closely associated on an interlocking basis. Each spent about $2.5 million dollars [nearly
                            $30 million when adjusted for inflation] over the quarter-century from 1925 to 1950, of
                            which <strong>about half, in each case, came from the Carnegie Foundation and the
                                Rockefeller Foundation</strong> (which were themselves interlocking groups controlled by
                            an alliance of Morgan and Rockefeller interests in Wall Street). Much of the rest…came from
                            firms closely allied to these two Wall Street interests, such as Standard Oil, International
                            Telephone and Telegraph, International General Electric, the National City Bank, and the
                            Chase National Bank.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote">[13]</a></p>

                            recommendations, and research or publication opportunities, <strong>could favor persons who
                                accepted the established consensus and could injure, financially or in professional

                                much of this group's influence arose from its access to and control over the flow of

                            handful of great American universities concerned with the Far East required similar
                            sponsorship. And, finally, <strong>there can be little doubt that consultant jobs on Far

                                jobs, were consulted, and who were appointed intermittently to government missions were
                                those who were tolerant of the IPR line.</strong><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15"

                    <p>Amazingly, after admitting all of this, Quigley somehow concludes:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The charges…accepted and proliferated by the neo-isolationists in the 1950's and by the
                            radical Right in the 1960's, that China was "lost" because of this group, or that the
                            members of this group were disloyal to the United States, or engaged in espionage, or were
                            participants in a conscious plot, or that the whole group was controlled by Soviet agents or
                            even by Communists, is not true.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote">[16]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In Quigley's defense, the last part of his statement is obviously accurate: the group wasn't
                        controlled by "Soviet agents or even Communists." Rather, according to Quigley himself, the
                        group was controlled by a secret network of individuals who "have no aversion to cooperating
                        with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so."<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17"
                            class="footnote">[17]</a> But does this fact somehow exonerate them from a charge of
                        "disloyalty"? Does it change the nature of their "conscious plot" to fabricate "consensus" on US
                        policy toward China? Does it lessen their impact on the ultimate fate of China? No.</p>

                    <p>This is one of many cases where Quigley expresses a clear bias toward the Network and its
                        <em>instruments</em>. Clearly, this bias clouds his judgment. For instance, he repeatedly
                        describes the Network's methodical deception of others, but apparently he never questions
                        whether he too might have been deceived. He describes the carnage of their "mistaken" policies,
                        but their <em>good intentions</em> are always accepted without a second thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>Combine this favorable bias with his open contempt for "the radical Right" and
                        "neo-isolationists," and poorly reasoned conclusions are nearly unavoidable. His casual
                        dismissal of the IPR's role in the fate of China provides but one shining example. That Quigley
                        can admit the IPR had tremendous financial and political power, a specific agenda, and actually
                        <em>achieved</em> its goals, but then attribute the rise of Mao Zedong solely to the
                        "incompetence and corruption" of Chiang Kai-shek's regime is difficult to explain.<a

                            in 1925 the civil war in China conveniently began. One possible reason (conjecture) for why
                            the Network might have preferred a Communist regime in China is found in the following
                            statement:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>From the broadest point of view the situation was this: The rivalry between the two
                                super-Powers [the United States and Soviet Union] could be balanced and its tensions
                                reduced only by the coming into existence of another Great Power on the land mass of
                                Eurasia. There were three possibilities of this: a federated and prosperous Western
                                Europe, India, or China. The first was essential; one of the others was highly
                                desirable; and possibly all three might be achievable<strong>, but in no case was it
                                    essential, or even desirable, for the new Great Power to be allied with the United
                                    States</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>If the Soviet Union were boxed in by the allies of the United States, it would
                                    feel threatened by the United States</strong>, <strong>and would seek security by
                                    more intensive exploitation of its resources in a military direction,</strong> with
                                a natural increase in world tension. If, on the other hand, the Soviet Union were boxed
                                in by at least two great neutral Powers, it could be kept from extensive expansion by
                                (1) the initial strength of such great Powers and (2) the possibility that these Powers
                                would ally with the United States if the Soviet Union put pressure on them.<a

                        </blockquote>

                        <p>The "Great Game" of playing one side off another, engaging in balance-of-power politics, is
                            discussed many times throughout Quigley's book. I've included the reference above only
                            because it provides a potentially logical motive (at least logical in the Realpolitik sense
                            of the word) for the Network's policy toward China.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Now, returning to Quigley's characterization of the IPR scandal and the subsequent lack of media
                        coverage referenced earlier: As a result of continuing pressure, spurred on by the "radical
                        Right," the Network soon found itself the target of two Congressional investigations. Quigley
                        describes the second of these investigations, the Reece Committee, this way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>A congressional committee, following backward to their source the threads which led from
                            admitted Communists like Whittaker Chambers, through Alger Hiss, and the Carnegie Endowment
                            to Thomas Lamont and the Morgan Bank, fell into the whole complicated network of the
                            interlocking tax-exempt foundations. The Eighty-third Congress in July 1953 set up a Special
                            Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations with Representative B. Carroll Reece, of
                            Tennessee, as chairman. It soon became clear that people of immense wealth would be unhappy
                            if the investigation went too far and that the "most respected" newspapers in the country,
                            closely allied with these men of wealth, would not get excited enough about any
                            [revelations] to make the publicity worth while, in terms of votes or campaign
                            contributions. An interesting report showing the Left-wing associations of the interlocking
                            nexus of tax-exempt foundations was issued in 1954 rather quietly. Four years later, the
                            Reece committee's general counsel, Rene A. Wormser, wrote a shocked, but not shocking, book
                            on the subject called <em>Foundations: Their Power and Influence.</em><a href="#fn20"
                                id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Quigley closes this chapter on the Network with the following:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The financial circles of London and those of the eastern United States…reflects <strong>one
                                of the most powerful influences in the twentieth-century American and world
                                history</strong>. The two ends of this English-speaking axis have sometimes been called,
                            perhaps facetiously, the English and American Establishments. There is, however, a
                            considerable degree of truth behind the joke, a truth which reflects a <strong>very real
                                power structure</strong>. It is this power structure which the Radical Right in the
                            United States has been attacking for years in the belief that they are attacking the
                            Communists.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Again, as Quigley points out, the power structure that he exposed isn't loyal to Communism, or
                        Socialism, or Fascism, or capitalism. The Network is happy to exploit the rhetoric of
                        <em>any</em> movement or ideology, prop up any dictator or tyrant, and support any economic or
                        political model, provided it serves their one overarching aim. That aim, to bring "all the
                        habitable portions of the world under <em>their</em> control," is as old as the lust for power
                        itself. The death and suffering that their policies have already caused in pursuit of this aim
                        are incalculable. Allowing them to continue as they have will only bring more of the same. As W.
                        Cleon Skousen states in <em>The Naked Capitalist</em>:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As I see it, the great contribution which Dr. Carroll Quigley unintentionally made by writing
                            <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> was to help the ordinary American realize the utter contempt which
                            the network leaders have for ordinary people. Human beings are treated <em>en masse</em> as
                            helpless puppets on an international chess board where giants of economic and political
                            power subject them to wars, revolution, civil strife, confiscation, subversion,
                            indoctrination, manipulation and deception.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Skousen hit the nail on the head. <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> revealed something even more
                        important than "one of the most powerful influences in the twentieth-century American and world
                        history." It inadvertently revealed the <em>mind-set</em> of those who wield such power. It
                        exposed the astonishing arrogance and hypocrisy of those who feel they have the right to rule
                        billions of other human beings.</p>

                    <p>If there is one goal for this book, it is to expose the attitude and inherent nature of those who
                        seek to dominate others. Don't worry about remembering all of the dates and names that have been
                        listed. Don't worry about trying to recall all of the specific events. (All of that information
                        will always be here if you need to find it again.) Instead, make it a point to simply verify the
                        following: there is no lie that these men will not tell. There is no crime that they will not
                        commit. The only measure of "right" and "wrong," in their view, is whether their tactics succeed
                        or fail. This might sound like hyperbole now, but by the end of this short book you will
                        understand the truth of this assertion. (The Network's game is won by those who calculate
                        properly, and <em>moral</em> considerations only impede accurate calculation.)</p>

                    <h2>An Introduction to Realpolitik</h2>

                    <p>Henry Kissinger personifies the essence of the Network mind-set. In his book <em>Diplomacy,
                        </em>he introduces his readers to the amoral concepts of <em>raison d'état</em> (translated as
                        "reasons of state," or state interests) and <em>Realpolitik</em>. The basis of both concepts,
                        Kissinger explains, is that individual <em>men</em> can be judged negatively on moral grounds,
                        but governments cannot. When it comes to government action, the only suitable judgment is based
                        on whether or not the government achieves its ends.<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22"
                            class="footnote">[22]</a> Throughout his book, Kissinger praises those who are wise enough
                        to govern by these concepts and practically mocks those who object on so-called "moral" grounds.
                    </p>

                    <p>In praise of Cardinal de Richelieu (a seventeenth-century French statesman), Kissinger writes:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Though privately religious, [Richelieu] viewed his duties as minister in entirely secular
                            terms. Salvation might be his personal objective, but to Richelieu, the statesman, it was
                            irrelevant. "Man is immortal, his salvation is hereafter," he once said. "The state has no
                            immortality, its salvation is now or never." In other words, states do not receive credit in
                            any world for doing what is right; they are only rewarded for being strong enough to do what
                            is necessary.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a></p>

                        <p>As the King's First Minister, [Richelieu] subsumed both religion and morality to <em>raison
                                d'état, </em>his guiding light.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote">[24]</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>Richelieu was indeed the manipulator described, and did use religion [as a tool of
                            manipulation]. He would no doubt have replied that he had merely analyzed the world as it
                            was, much as Machiavelli had. Like Machiavelli, he might well have preferred a world of more
                            refined moral sensibilities, but he was convinced that history would judge his statesmanship
                            by how well he had used the conditions and the factors he was given to work with.<a
                                href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote">[25]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>To clarify, according to statesman like Kissinger, the moral and legislative laws that limit the
                        actions of ordinary men do not apply to a select few. To escape accountability, the ruling class
                        needs only to invoke the name of the state. This, of course, is the same position held by past
                        rulers who justified theft, deceit, torture, slavery, and slaughter <em>in the name of God</em>.
                        The tactic has simply been modernized. Our new rulers have substituted "the state" for God. And
                        conveniently for them, they <em>are</em> the state…and not just any state; they are the
                        emerging, omnipotent, <em>global</em> state.</p>

                    <p>Though citizens have been conditioned to believe that their statesmen and government instruments
                        are in place to serve <em>them</em>, nothing could be further from the truth. Both the
                        instruments and statesmen are part of an institutional apparatus that exists for the benefit of
                        those who control it. Put another way: the <em>state</em> is nothing more than a collection of
                        men and women who direct the resources and policies of government. Contrary to popular belief,
                        it is an <em>institution</em> that exists for its own sake, to ensure its own "salvation," and
                        to prevent the rise of anything that might challenge its power.</p>

                    <p>This is a harsh reality, and some will surely object on the grounds that the modern state is
                        different. After all, it is built on the consent of the people. Democratic elections enable
                        citizens to vote for who their leaders will be. They can choose from Republicans or Democrats.
                        They can throw either out of office if they break their campaign promises.</p>

                    <p>But what if our so-called representative government is all a carefully crafted illusion? What if
                        the Network <em>chooses</em> the candidates that we get to vote for? What if the Network's
                        "experts," not the figureheads placed in official positions of power, are the ones who
                        ultimately determine government policy? What if both political parties, right and left, are
                        controlled by the exact same people? Quigley shines some light on this topic as well:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps,
                            of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and
                            academic thinkers. Instead, <strong>the two parties should be almost identical, so that the
                                American people can "throw the rascals out" at any election without leading to any
                                profound or extensive shifts in policy</strong>.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26"
                                class="footnote">[26]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Quigley goes even further when describing the system that's now emerging:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It is increasingly clear that, in the twentieth century, <strong>the expert will replace…the
                                democratic voter in control of the political system</strong>…<strong>Hopefully, the
                                elements of choice and freedom may survive for the ordinary individual</strong> in that
                            he may be free to make a choice between two opposing political groups (even if these groups
                            have little policy choice within the parameters of policy established by the
                            experts)…<strong>in general, his freedom and choice will be controlled within very narrow
                                alternatives.</strong><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote">[27]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Does that statement alarm you? Let's hope so.</p>

                    <h2>Facing Reality</h2>

                    <p>Using Quigley's work as a starting point, this book will highlight how a small group of dominant
                        men were able to secure control of local, national, continental, and even global policy. Though
                        the power of this network is not complete, they are moving inexorably in that direction. Without
                        increased awareness (and resistance), their unelected and unaccountable global state will become
                        a reality. And though the illusion of national sovereignty might be maintained, the freedom of
                        the world's citizens "will be controlled within very narrow alternatives."</p>

                    <p>Before moving on to the next chapter, here are some of the key insights that we will cover in
                        this book:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Real</em> power is unelected. Politicians change, but the power structure does not. The
                            Network operates behind the scenes, for its own benefit, without ever consulting those who
                            are affected by its decisions.</li>

                        <li>The Network is composed of individuals who <em>prefer</em> anonymity. They are "satisfied to
                            possess the reality rather than the appearance of power."<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28"
                                class="footnote">[28]</a> This approach of secretly exercising power is common
                            throughout history because it protects the conspirators from the consequences of their
                            actions.</li>

                        <li>A primary tactic for directing public opinion and "government" policy is to place willing
                            servants in leadership positions of trusted institutions (media, universities, government,
                            foundations, etc.). If there is ever a major backlash against a given policy, the servant
                            can be replaced. This leaves both the institution and the individuals who actually direct
                            its power unharmed.</li>

                        <li>Historically, those who establish sophisticated systems of domination are not only highly
                            intelligent; they are supremely deceptive and ruthless. They completely ignore the ethical
                            barriers that govern a normal human being's behavior. They do not believe that the moral and
                            legislative laws, which others are expected to abide by, apply to them. This gives them an
                            enormous advantage over the masses that cannot easily imagine their mind-set.</li>

                        <li>Advances in technology have enabled modern rulers to dominate larger and larger areas of the
                            globe.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote">[29]</a> As a result, the
                            <em>substance</em> of national sovereignty has already been destroyed, and whatever remains
                            of its shell is being dismantled as quickly as possible. The new system they're building
                            (which they themselves refer to as a <em>New World Order</em>), will trade the existing
                            illusion of democratically directed government for their long-sought, "expert-directed,"
                            authoritarian technocracy.<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote">[30]</a>

                    <p>To be sure, it's difficult to accept these statements upon first hearing them. They challenge our
                        world view and force us to reconsider everything that we've been taught to believe. It's much
                        easier to dismiss these facts without further investigation; it's easier to accept comforting
                        lies that alleviate our anxieties. But this, of course, is exactly the opposite of what must be
                        done. If we allow ourselves to be manipulated, we empower the Network at our own expense.</p>

                    <p>Edward Bernays, perhaps more than anyone, helped establish the modern system of public
                        manipulation. Drawing on the psychoanalytical techniques of his uncle, Sigmund Freud, Bernays
                        became known as the father of propaganda.<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote">[31]</a>
                        His low opinion of the masses is best expressed in his own words. The following quotes are taken
                        from his book <em>Propaganda</em>:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>No serious sociologist any longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine
                            or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people,
                            and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders…and by those persons who understand the
                            manipulation of public opinion.</p>

                        <p>If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control
                            and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it?</p>

                        <p>Whatever attitude one chooses toward this condition…we are dominated by the small number of
                            persons who understand the mental processes of the masses. It is they who pull the wires
                            which control the public mind and contrive new ways to guide the world.</p>

                        <p>Political campaigns today are all sideshows…A presidential candidate may be "drafted" in
                            response to "overwhelming popular demand," but it is well known that his name may be decided
                            upon by half a dozen men sitting around a table in a hotel room.</p>

                        <p>The conscious manipulation of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those
                            who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is
                            the true ruling power of our country.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Bertrand Russell, historian, philosopher, mathematician, cofounder of analytic philosophy,<a
                            href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote">[32]</a> and expert on the scientific method of
                        human manipulation, describes a global "society of experts" this way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The society of experts will control propaganda and education. It will teach loyalty to the
                            world government, and make nationalism high treason. The government, being an oligarchy,
                            will instill submissiveness into the great bulk of the population…It is possible that
                            <strong>it may invent ingenious ways of concealing its own power, leaving the forms of
                                democracy intact, and allowing the plutocrats or politicians to imagine that they are
                                cleverly controlling these forms…whatever the outward forms may be, all real power will
                                come to be concentrated in the hands of those who understand the art of scientific
                                manipulation.</strong><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote">[33]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Purveyors of the <em>democratic</em> illusion assure us that sophisticated conspiracies and
                        powerful <em>secret societies</em> exist only in the mind of paranoids and extremists. Their
                        assurances are a lie. With Quigley as our guide, we'll trace the origins and operations of the
                        Network that, by "concealing its own power," seeks to secretly dominate our world.</p>

                        <p>[9] While we're on the topic of front groups, it's worth noting that Rothschild interests
                            likely used Morgan as a front <em>man</em>. In <em>The Secrets of the Federal Reserve</em>,
                            Eustace Mullins writes on page 49: "Soon after he arrived in London, George Peabody was
                            surprised to be summoned to an audience with the gruff Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild.
                            Without mincing words, Rothschild revealed to Peabody, that much of the London aristocracy
                            openly disliked Rothschild and refused his invitations. He proposed that Peabody, a man of
                            modest means, be established as a lavish host whose entertainments would soon be the talk of
                            London. Rothschild would, of course, pay all the bills. Peabody accepted the offer, and soon
                            became known as the most popular host in London. It's hardly surprising that the most
                            popular host in London would also become a very successful businessman, particularly with
                            the House of Rothschild supporting him behind the scenes." Quigley acknowledges that the
                            Morgan firm originated as George Peabody and Company (on pages 326 and 945 of <em>Tragedy
                                and Hope</em>). <a href="#fnref9">↩</a></p>
