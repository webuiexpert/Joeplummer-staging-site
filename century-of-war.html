                    protection for their national security, the game appeared endless." + "As Henry Kissinger once
                    expressed…'control energy and you control the nations.'"</p>

                    trade:</p>

                <p>"British control of the seas, and with it control of world shipping trade, was thus to emerge after
                    Waterloo as one of the three pillars of a new British Empire. The manufacturers of Continental
                    Europe, as well as much of the rest of the world, were forced to respond to terms of trade set in
                    London by the Lloyd's shipping insurance and banking syndicates. While Her Royal Britannic Majesty's
                    Navy, the world's largest in that day, policed the world's major sea-lanes and provided cost-free
                    'insurance' for British merchant shipping vessels, competitor fleets were forced to insure their
                    ships against piracy, catastrophe and acts of war, through London's large Lloyd's insurance
                    syndicate."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">5-6</span>: Must rule the "vulgar ignorant masses" + informal empire:</p>

                <p>"British liberalism, as it was defined towards the end of the nineteenth century, justified
                    development of an ever more powerful imperial elite class, ruling on behalf of the 'vulgar ignorant
                    masses,' who could not be entrusted to rule on their own behalf." + "By the end of the nineteenth
                    century, the British establishment began an intense debate over how to maintain its global empire.
                    Amid slogans about a new era of 'anti-imperialism,' beginning the last quarter of the nineteenth
                    century, Britain embarked on a more sophisticated and far more effective form for maintaining its
                    dominant world role, through what came to be called 'informal empire.' …The notion of special
                    economic relationships with 'client states,' the concept of 'spheres of influence' as well as that
                    of 'balance-of-power diplomacy,' all came out of this complex weave of British 'informal empire'
                    towards the end of the last century."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">6</span>: British "Balance of power" AKA the "great game":<br>"British
                    diplomacy cultivated this cynical doctrine, which dictated that Britain should never hold
                    sentimental or moral relations with other nations as sovereign respected partners, but rather,
                    should develop her own 'interests.' British alliance strategies were dictated strictly by what she
                    determined at any given period might best serve her own 'interests.' The shift from hostile
                    relations with France in Africa to the Entente Cordiale' after the Fashoda showdown in 1898, or the
                    shift from Britain's decades-long backing for Ottoman Turkey to blocking the expansion of Russia, in
                    what was known in Britain and India as the 'Great Game,' were indicative of such dramatic alliance
                    shifts."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">7:</span> Use money to control client states, "imperialism on the cheap"</p>

                <p>"So were the economies of Argentina and other British 'client states' effectively made into an
                    economic captive, with terms of trade and finance dictated from the City of London by British
                    merchant houses and trade finance banks. These client states of Britain thereby found that they had
                    surrendered control over their essential economic sovereignty far more completely than if British
                    troops had occupied Buenos Aires to enforce tax collection in support of the British Empire.</p>

                <p>During the 1880s [Argentina was made] a debt vassal of the British Empire, 'imperialism on the cheap'
                    as one commentator dubbed it. It was manifestly not the intent of British policy to develop strong
                    sovereign industrial economies from these client-state relationships. Rather, it was to make the
                    minimum investment necessary to control, while ensuring that other rival powers did not gain coveted
                    raw materials or other treasures of economic power."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">7-8</span>: British Secret Intelligence trained what would become the CIA in
                    America; it was a secret mix of "private" and "public" power:</p>

                <p>"British secret intelligence services…evolved in an unusual manner. Unlike the empires of France or
                    other nations, Britain modelled its post-Waterloo empire on an extremely sophisticated marriage
                    between top bankers and financiers of the City of London, government cabinet ministers, heads of key
                    industrial companies deemed strategic to the national interest, and the heads of the espionage
                    services…Rather than traditional service providing data from agents of espionage in foreign
                    capitals, Britain's secret intelligence services operated as a secret, Masonic-like network which
                    wove together the immense powers of British banking, shipping, industry and government. Because all
                    this was secret, it wielded immense power over credulous and unsuspecting foreign economies. In the
                    Free Trade era after 1846, this covert marriage of private commercial power with government was the
                    secret of British hegemony."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">12</span>: Germany makes huge gains over Britain</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">16 - 23</span>: By 1914, Germany threatens British shipping dominance:</p>

                <p>"So long as Germany did not control her own modern merchant ship fleet, and have a navy to defend it,
                    she could never determine her own economic affairs. Britain was still the sovereign on the world's
                    oceans, and intended to remain so. This was the heart of British geopolitical strategy. Under such
                    conditions, argued an increasing majority in Germany, the nation's economic life would be ever
                    subject to the manipulations of a foreign shipping power for the essential terms of its vital
                    international trade…By 1914, Germany's fleet had risen to second place, just behind Britain's and
                    gaining rapidly."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">19</span>: Advantages of oil over coal:</p>

                <p>"At least one man understood the military-strategic implications of petroleum for future control of
                    the world seas…in September 1882, Britain's Admiral Lord Fisher…argued to anyone in the British
                    establishment who would listen that Britain must convert its naval fleet from bulky coal-fired
                    propulsion to the new oil fuel…He insisted that oil power would allow Britain to maintain decisive
                    strategic advantage in future control of the seas.</p>

                <p>Fisher had done his homework on the qualitative superiority of petroleum over coal as a fuel…A
                    battleship powered by a diesel motor burning petroleum issued no tell-tale smoke, while a coal
                    ship's emission was visible up to ten kilometers away. Where some four to nine hours were required
                    for a coal-fired ship's motor to reach full power, an oil motor required a mere 30 minutes and could
                    reach peak power within five minutes. To provide oil fuel for a battleship required the work of
                    twelve men for twelve hours. The same equivalent of energy for a coal ship required the work of 500
                    men for five days."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">20</span>: UK has no oil of its own, created unacceptable dependence on
                    others:</p>

                <p>"By 1905, the British secret services and the British government had finally realized the strategic
                    importance of the new fuel. Britain's problem was that it had no known oil of its own. It must rely
                    on America, Russia or Mexico to supply it, an unacceptable condition in time of peace, impossible in
                    the event of a major war…Fisher promptly established a committee to 'consider and make
                    recommendations as to how the British navy shall secure its oil supplies.'"</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">20-22</span>: Tricked into signing over oil rights:</p>

                <p>"In 1905, His Majesty's Government, through the agency of the notorious British 'ace of spies,'
                    Sidney Reilly, secured an extraordinarily significant exclusive right over what were then believed
                    to be vast untapped petroleum deposits in the Middle East…Reilly, disguised as a priest, and
                    skillfully playing on d'Arcy's strong religious inclinations, persuaded d'Arcy…to sign over his
                    exclusive rights to Persian oil resources in an agreement with a British company which he claimed to
                    be a good 'Christian' enterprise, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company…the government's own role in
                    Anglo-Persian was kept secret. Reilly had thus secured Britain's first major petroleum source."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">22-24</span>: Mounting friction between Britain and Germany – Britain did not
                    want a "Berlin to Baghdad" railroad, too much power for the nations involved; Britain did all it
                    could to sabotage the project, while pretending to work on an agreement:</p>

                <p>"For more than two decades, the question of the construction of a modern railway linking Continental
                    Europe with Baghdad was a point of friction at the center of German-English relations. By the
                    estimation of Deutsche Bank director Karl Helfferich, the person responsible at the time for the
                    Baghdad rail project negotiations, no other issue led to greater tension between London and Berlin
                    in the decade and a half before 1914, with the possible exception of the issue of Germany's growing
                    naval fleet.</p>

                <p>For the first time, the railway gave Constantinople and the Ottoman Empire a vital modern economic
                    linkage with its entire Asiatic interior. The rail link, once extended to Baghdad and a short
                    distance further to Kuwait, would provide the cheapest and fastest link between Europe and the
                    entire Indian subcontinent… 'If Berlin-Baghdad were achieved, a huge block of territory producing
                    every kind of economic wealth, and unassailable by sea-power, would be united under German
                    authority,' warned…a senior British military adviser."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">28-29</span>: Germany, using railway, seeks oil independence, Britain buys BP
                    + quote about German power being unacceptable; war the only solution:</p>

                <p>"The Deutsche Bank plan was to have the Baghdad rail link transport Mesopotamian oil over land, free
                    from possible naval blockade by the British, thereby making Germany independent in its petroleum
                    requirements…By early 1913, acting secretly, again at Churchill's urging, the British government
                    bought up majority share ownership of Anglo-Persian Oil (today British Petroleum). From this point,
                    oil was at the core of British strategic interest…if [Britain] could deny economic rivals their
                    access to secure petroleum reserves in the world, her dominant role might be maintained into the
                    next decades…Many in the British establishment had determined well before 1914 that war was the only
                    course suitable to bring the European situation under control."</p>

                <p><span class="page-ref">33-34</span>: Britain blocks Trans-Siberian railway:<br>"Colqhum declared:
                    'This line will not only be one of the greatest trade routes that the world has ever known, but it
                    will also become a political weapon in the hands of the Russians whose power and significance it is
                    difficult to estimate. It will make a single nation out of Russia, for whom it will no longer be
                    necessary to pass through the Dardanelles or through the Suez Canal. It will give her an economic
                    independence, through which she will become stronger than she has ever been or ever dreamed of
                    becoming.' For decades, the British balance-of-power alliance strategy in Europe had been built
                    around support for Ottoman Turkey's empire, as part of what British strategists called the Great
                    Game – blocking the emergence of a strong and industrialized Russia. Support for Turkey, which
                    controlled the vital Dardanelles access to warm waters for Russia, had been a vital part of British
                    geopolitics until that time. But as German economic links with the Ottoman Empire grew stronger at
                    the end of the century and into the early 1900s, so too did British overtures to Russia, and against
                    Turkey and Germany.</p>

                <p>Following British consolidation of its new Triple Entente strategy of encirclement of Germany and her
                    allies, a series of continuous crises and regional wars were unleashed in the Balkans, the 'soft
                    underbelly' of Central Europe. In the so-called First Balkan War of 1912, Serbia, Bulgaria and
                    Greece, secretly backed by England, declared war against the weak Ottoman Turkey, resulting in
                    stripping Turkey of most of her European possessions. This was followed in 1913 by a second Balkan
                    War over the spoils of the first, in which Romania joined to help crush Bulgaria. The stage was
                    being set for Britain's great European war.</p>

                <p>"Britain's decision in August 1914 to go to war against German on the Continent was remarkable to say
                    the least, given that the British Treasury and the pound sterling system, the then-dominant currency
                    system of world trade and finance, were de facto bankrupt."</p>

                    win…Without oil, how could they have procured the mobility of the fleet, the transport of their

                <p>"Britain had gained the invaluable military assistance of Arab forces [by assuring] the Arab forces
                    who served under the command of T.E. Lawrence ('Lawrence of Arabia') that the reward for their help
                    in defeating the Turks would be British assurance of full postwar Arab sovereignty and
                    independence….Lawrence was fully aware of the British fraud to the Arabs at the time. As he admitted
                    some years later in his memoirs,</p>

                <p>'I risked the fraud on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap and speedy victory in
                    the East, and that better we win and break our word, than lose…The Arab inspiration was our main
                    tool for winning the Eastern war. So I assured them that England kept her word in letter and spirit.
                    In this comfort they performed their fine things; but of course, instead of being proud of what we

                    government in Costa Rica in 1918, in return for which his BCO was rewarded with an oil concession
                    covering 7 million acres, near to the Panama border and the important Canal Zone. The United States
                    had refused to recognize Tinoco, and, when in 1921 a border dispute 'arose' between Panama and Costa

                    most especially that with BCO, to be 'null and void.' American oil companies immediately got large

                    they controlled. Their control of then-emerging network television, centered in New York, where it
                    enjoyed intimate links with the big international banks of McCloy and friends, and their control
                    over select news media such as the <em>New York Times</em>, were central to the success of these New

                    colossal assault against industrial growth in the world, in order to tilt the balance of power back
                    to the advantage of Anglo-American financial interests and the dollar. In order to do this, they
                    determined to use their most prized weapon – control of the world's oil flows. Bilderberg policy was
                    to trigger a global oil embargo, in order to force a dramatic increase in world oil prices. Since
                    1945, world oil had by international custom been priced in dollars…A sudden sharp increase in the
                    world price of oil, therefore, meant an equally dramatic increase in world demand for U.S. dollars

                </p>

                <p>"Contrary to popular impression, the 'Yom Kippur' War was not the simple result of miscalculation,
                    blunder or an Arab decision to launch a military strike against the state of Israel. The entire
                    constellation of events surrounding the outbreak of the October War was secretly orchestrated by
                    Washington and London, using the powerful secret diplomatic channels developed by Nixon's national
                    security adviser, Henry Kissinger. Kissinger effectively controlled the Israeli policy response
                    through his intimate relation with Israel's Washington ambassador…In addition, Kissinger cultivated
                    channels for the Egyptian and Syrian side. His method was simply to misrepresent to each party the
                    critical elements of the other, ensuring the war and its subsequent Arab oil embargo. U.S.
                    intelligence reports, including intercepted communications from Arab officials confirming the
                    buildup for war, were firmly suppressed by Kissinger, who was by then Nixon's intelligence
                    'czar.'…Significantly, the oil crisis hit full force in late 1973, just as the president of the
                    United States was becoming personally embroiled in what came to be called the 'Watergate affair,'
                    leaving Henry Kissinger as de facto president, running U.S. policy during the crisis…Kissinger, as
                    Nixon's all-powerful national security adviser already firmly in control of all U.S. intelligence
                    estimates, secured control of U.S. foreign policy as well, persuading Nixon to name him secretary of
                    state in the weeks just prior to the outbreak of the October Yom Kippur War. Indicative of his
                    central role in events, Kissinger retained both titles, as head of the White House National Security
                    Council and as secretary of state, something no other individual has ever done, before or since. No
                    other single person during the last months of the Nixon presidency wielded as much absolute power as
                    did Henry Kissinger. To add insult to injury, Kissinger was given the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize."</p>

                    and "strategic targets" for population control:</p>

                <p>"In 1798…Thomas Malthus…was given instant fame by his English sponsors for his 'Essay on the
                    Principle of Population.' The essay itself was a scientific fraud, plagiarized largely
                    from…Gianmaria Ortes…Malthus' adaptation of Ortes' 'theory' was refined with a façade of
                    mathematical legitimacy which he called the 'law of geometric progression,' which held that human
                    populations invariably expanded geometrically, while the means of subsistence were arithmetically
                    limited, or linear. The flaw in Malthus' argument, as demonstrated irrefutably by the spectacular
                    growth of civilization, technology and agriculture productivity since 1798, was Malthus' deliberate
                    ignoring of the contribution of advances in science and technology to dramatically improving such
                    factors as crop yields, labor productivity and the like. By the mid-1970's, as an indication of the
                    effectiveness of the new propaganda onslaught from the Anglo-American establishment, American
                    government officials were openly boasting in public press conferences that they were committed
                    'neo-Malthusians…" Nowhere did the new embrace of British Malthusian economics in the United States
                    show itself more brutally than in Kissinger's National Security Council.</p>

                <p>On April 24, 1974…the white House national security adviser, Henry Alfred Kissinger, issued National
                    Security Council Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200), on the subject of 'Implications of Worldwide
                    Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests.' It was directed to all cabinet
                    secretaries, the military Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as the CIA and other key agencies…NSSM 200
                    argued that population expansion in select developing countries which also contain key strategic
                    resources necessary to the U.S. economy posed potential U.S. 'national security threats.' The study
                    warned that, under pressure from expanding domestic populations, countries with essential raw
                    materials will tend to demand higher prices and better terms of trade for their exports to the
                    United States. In this context, NSSM 200 identified a target list of 13 countries singled out as
                    'strategic targets' for U.S. efforts at population control…The United States, with this secret
                    policy declaration, had committed itself to an agenda which would contribute to its own economic
                    demise, as well as bringing untold famine, misery and unnecessary death throughout the developing

                <p>"While industrial countries had experienced a certain slow recovery from the initial oil shock by
                    1975, the overall position of developing economies deteriorated as a result of the quadrupling of
                    primary oil prices. The total current-account deficit of all developing countries rose from an
                    average of some $6 billion per year during the early 1970's to more than $26 billion in 1974…and to
                    $42 billion, an unbearable seven-fold increase, by 1976. The vast majority of this deficit was in
                    countries of the developing sector, whose per capita income levels were the lowest in the
                    world…Under the threat of losing access to further borrowings from the World Bank and the private
                    banks of the industrial nations, these less-developed countries were forced to divert precious funds
                    from industrial and agricultural development into simply reducing this balance-of-payments deficit.
                    Their oil imports had to be paid, and paid in dollars, while the cost of their raw materials exports
                    had fallen sharply in the global recession of 1974 – 1975."</p>

                    unstable petroleum-based dollar exchange system, which, unlike the gold exchange system, they
                    reckoned they could control. Kissinger and the financial establishment of London and New York had in

                    burden of 'refinancing' the unpayable old debt…The same process was repeated in Argentina, Brazil,
                    Peru Venezuela, most of black Africa, including Zambia, Zaire and Egypt, and large parts of Asia.

                <p>"On July 27, 1990, when tensions between Iraq and Kuwait over oil prices were at a peak, the U.S.
                    Ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, asked for a meeting with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad to discuss
                    the tense situation. According to official Iraqi transcripts of the exchange, later released by the
                    Baghdad government and confirmed by U.S. Congress almost a year later, Glaspie told Saddam that
                    Washington would not take a position on the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait…What followed during the

                    it dealt with Eurasia, from Europe to the Pacific. Former presidential adviser and geostrategist,
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski, put it bluntly: '…in terminology that hearkens back to the more brutal age of
                    empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain
                    security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the

                    strategy and is demonized and attacked + camp Bondsteel:</p>

                <p>"Slobodan Milosevic, the elected Yugoslav president, a former banker who had once, when it was
                    thought he might play the IMF game, enjoyed the backing of Washington, became a new 'Adolf Hitler'
                    in the U.S. media. Numerous accounts from the region and from impartial outside observers confirmed
                    that by the mid 1990's, all sides in the destabilized former Yugoslavia were guilty of
                    atrocities…Washington and NATO-scripted media reports concentrated, however, on only one side: the
                    recalcitrant Serb president Milosevic. So long as a well-defended enclave remained in the middle of
                    the Balkans, which rejected IMF 'reform' and the presence of NATO, the long-term geopolitical agenda
                    of Washington for the control of the Caspian pipeline routes and central Asia was blocked.</p>

                <p>By early 1999, the Clinton administration had decided the time was right to change all that. An
                    indignant Milosevic rejected a U.S. demand…mandating that he allow NATO troops to occupy Kosovo, and
                    potentially Serbia, 'for humanitarian reasons of preventing genocide.' Milosevic's predictable
                    rejection was used to justify war. Washington began a massive bombing campaign, ignoring the
                    niceties of international law, the UN Charter (and indeed any involvement at all of the UN in the
                    process), the NATO charter (which specifies a purely defensive role), the 1975 Helsinki accords, and
                    even the U.S. constitution (which mandates that only Congress has the power to declare war).
                    President Clinton cited 'humanitarian' reasons and the threat of imminent genocide against Kosovo
                    Albanians, and began a merciless bombing of civilian Serb targets.</p>

                <p>Thousands of tons of bombs later, and after an estimated $40 billion of destruction to the economy
                    and infrastructure of Serbia, the Pentagon began the construction of one of the largest U.S.
                    military bases anywhere in the world. Camp Bondsteel near Gnjilane in Southeast Kosovo, a fortress
                    housing 3,000 soldiers, an airfield and state-of-the-art telecommunications, gave the United States
                    a commanding and clearly permanent military presence in the strategic Balkans, within reach of the
                    Caspian Sea.</p>
