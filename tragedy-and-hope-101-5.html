                        <h1>CHAPTER FIVE<br>The Main Problem—The Main Solution</h1>
                    </div>

                    <p>So far we've covered how the Network uses money to control governments, businesses, and trusted
                        institutions. We've touched on how it developed ingenious ways to control other people's
                        financial resources—their savings accounts, their insurance payments, and even their
                        <em>income</em>. We've also gone over its greatest swindle of all: granting itself the legal
                        authority to <em>create money</em> out of thin air.
                    </p>

                    <p>With all of these monetary tools at its disposal, the Network has secretly and systematically
                        consolidated its power over global policies that affect the lives of billions of human beings.
                        Unelected, its members operate beyond the reach of voters. Unaccountable, they violate national
                        and international laws with impunity. Obviously, if we intend to unseat them, we cannot continue
                        playing by the rules of the system that <em>they</em> have created. We must be prepared to think
                        and act in unapproved ways, and that begins with striking the root of their power…money.</p>

                    <p>In short, our adversary is using our own purchasing power against us. The money that we place in
                        its institutions, the money we allow it to confiscate, and the money we allow it to
                        <em>create—</em>these revenue streams provide the Network <em>trillions</em> of dollars each
                        year to direct as it likes. Until we cut this funding, we are only wasting our time. On the
                        other side of the equation, these trillions of dollars represent the Network's Achilles' heel.
                        Without access to this money, it cannot continue to purchase the people and resources necessary
                        to defend its dominant position. (Their system is completely dependent upon the purchasing power
                        that we provide.)
                    </p>

                    <p>Knowing this, the answer to our dilemma seems very simple: reclaim our purchasing power and
                        destroy their illegitimate system in the process. And truthfully, it really <em>is</em> that
                        simple. But before getting into the obvious ways in which we can take back what is ours, there
                        is one final twist in this story of monetary power. First, we must dig a little deeper into the
                        story of money itself.</p>

                    <p>Few realize that money comes in many different forms. A basic list would include commodity money,
                        receipt money, fractional money, fiat money, and debt money. (This isn't as complicated as it
                        sounds; each form will be explained shortly.) Some of these forms of money are far easier to
                        abuse than others, with the last one on the list (debt money) being the worst. Debt money is
                        actually designed to enslave those who use it. No surprise then that debt money is what the
                        Network has chosen to create and spread to all corners of the globe.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Although slavery was abolished…many of the poor were reduced to peonage by contracting
                            debts…binding themselves and their heirs to work for their creditors until the debt was
                            paid. Such debt could never be paid in many cases, because the rate at which it was reduced
                            was left to the creditor and could rarely be questioned by the illiterate debtor.<a
                                href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This quote reveals that there is more than one way to reduce human beings to servitude. Though
                        Quigley is referencing a tactic that was used in mid-nineteenth century India, he perfectly
                        captures the spirit of the financial system we live under today. It is a system that creates
                        debt that "can never be paid," is "binding" on future generations, and is serviced by a global
                        population of "illiterate" debtors.</p>

                    <p>Today, the term "illiterate debtor" has nothing to do with an individual's ability to read,
                        write, or perform basic math. A person can possess all of these skills and still remain
                        completely illiterate when it comes to understanding the Network's debt-based monetary system.
                        Also, the indignities of "peonage" are no longer reserved exclusively for the poor. A person (or
                        nation) can be poor or they can be rich; it makes little difference. Those who create and
                        control the debt-money supply can manipulate the system and extract wealth from
                        <em>everyone</em> who uses their currency. Not even those who are debt-free are safe. To the
                        extent a person's income, savings, and assets are debt-money denominated, their purchasing power
                        and accumulated wealth are at risk.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since most people dislike being ripped off and exploited, it's reasonable to assume that the only
                        reason the masses tolerate this debt-money system is because they do not understand how it
                        works. That being the case, this chapter will attempt (in just a handful of pages) to end the
                        financial illiteracy that the Network absolutely <em>depends on</em>. Consider this a
                        super-abbreviated crash course on the topic, excerpted mainly from <em>Dishonest Money:
                            Financing the Road to Ruin</em>.</p>

                    <h2>What Is Money?</h2>

                    <p>To accurately define what money is, we can't simply hold up a US dollar or a Russian ruble or a
                        Mexican peso and say "This is money." We're better off to start by defining the overall purpose
                        of money. What does money <em>do</em>?</p>

                    <p>In the simplest terms, money enables us to purchase products and services from other people.
                        Using this basic description, we might go on to say <strong>money</strong> <strong><em>can
                                be</em></strong> <strong>anything that is widely accepted as</strong>
                        <strong><em>payment</em></strong> <strong>for products and services.</strong> Having defined
                        money in this way, it will be easier to explain the different forms of money and why some are
                        far more <em>honest</em> than others. But first, let's quickly touch on what existed before
                        money—barter.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Barter</h2>

                    <p>Prior to the creation of money, individuals used barter to trade with one another. This simply
                        means that they would "purchase" what they wanted with products or services rather than paying
                        for it with money. As an example, assume your neighbor grows corn, has one hundred extra pounds
                        of it, and you would like some. If you grow tomatoes, it's possible that your neighbor will
                        allow you to "buy" some of his corn using your tomatoes instead of money. Or, maybe he'll allow
                        you to provide a service of some sort in exchange for his corn. (Perhaps you're good at building
                        storage sheds, and he needs help building one.)</p>

                    <p>If the two of you are able to come to a barter agreement, then each of you will gain value from
                        the exchange. (Your neighbor turns his surplus corn into something <em>he'd</em> rather have;
                        you turn your surplus tomatoes or a couple days' work into something <em>you'd</em> rather
                        have.) However, if your neighbor isn't interested in your tomatoes, and if he doesn't need a new
                        storage shed, then both of you lose out. Both of you will have to find another trading partner.
                    </p>

                    <p>Though limited, barter at least provided an <em>opportunity</em> for individuals (and society as
                        a whole), to enjoy the benefits of trade. Rather than just having really good tomatoes and some
                        nice storage sheds, you could also have some really good corn, really good wheat, clothes,
                        furniture, or anything else that others had to offer. But again, you could only obtain these
                        things if others wanted what <em>you</em> had to offer in exchange. This was the big limitation
                        of barter, and it was overcome with the creation of commodity money.</p>

                    <h2>Commodity Money</h2>

                    <p>While trading with each other, people eventually realized that certain commodities were always in
                        high demand. For instance, they discovered corn was so high in demand that it could consistently
                        be traded for nearly anything. From that point forward, corn took on a value that exceeded its
                        <em>consumption value</em>. In other words, even though your neighbor already had all the corn
                        he needed, he would continue to grow (or acquire) more because he knew the corn would be
                        accepted as payment for the products and services of others. The more corn he had, the more
                        purchasing power he had. In this way, many different commodities (corn, wheat, cows, sheep,
                        etc.) eventually evolved into reliable forms of commodity money. But just as barter had its
                        limitations, so too did early forms of commodity money. These problems were eventually overcome
                        when metal was discovered.
                    </p>

                    <p>Unlike livestock, metal didn't need to be fed, watered, and cleaned up after. Unlike wheat and
                        corn, you didn't have to worry about metal going bad, becoming contaminated with bugs, growing
                        mold in storage, and so on. Also, metal was easily divisible. Assuming a milk cow was equal in
                        value to one hundred pounds of iron, and the sale price of an item was twenty-five pounds of
                        iron (or one-fourth of a milk cow), the individual buying with iron had a distinct advantage: he
                        could easily produce the exact amount of money needed. For these reasons, metal eventually
                        became the commodity money of choice, and though many different types of metal were used (iron,
                        copper, and tin to name a few), gold and silver coins became the standard around the world.</p>

                    <h2>Summary of Barter and Commodity Money</h2>

                    <p>Both commodity money <em>and</em> barter share a couple of desirable attributes. The first
                        attribute is transparency. If I want to trade my goat for some of your corn, I'll have to bring
                        my goat and you'll have to bring some corn. The odds of either of us walking away with something
                        else in our pocket, like a cricket, are pretty slim. Likewise, if I offer to buy something from
                        you with a Gold Eagle (US gold coin), I must hand over a Gold Eagle. There is little chance that
                        you will be duped into accepting a far less valuable Silver Eagle as payment for your item.</p>

                    <p>The second desirable attribute is the <em>intrinsic value</em> of the items traded. There are
                        significant natural barriers that limit the production of commodities and, as such, their
                        intrinsic value is transferred to anyone who acquires them. The person who acquires corn does
                        not have to grow and harvest the corn himself; the person who earns a gold coin does not have to
                        dig the gold out of the ground, fashion it into a coin, and convince others of its authenticity.
                        Nobody can simply create gold, corn, or a goat with the flick of a pen. For this reason, these
                        items will always possess the intrinsic value of the labor and the other costs that produced
                        them.</p>

                    <p>These two attributes (transparency and intrinsic value) made it reasonably difficult to defraud
                        people in trade because it isn't easy to convince somebody that you've paid them with a goat
                        when, in fact, you've handed them a cricket. But just as barter led to the invention of
                        commodity money, and commodity money eventually evolved into metal coins made from gold and
                        silver, the inconveniences of gold and silver coins eventually led to the creation of a new form
                        of money. And with it, the ability to easily defraud people (the ability to create money with
                        "the flick of a pen") was born.</p>

                    <h2>Receipt Money</h2>

                    <p>Gold and silver coins were a much improved form of commodity money, but they still had some
                        drawbacks. For instance, if you were even moderately wealthy, finding a place to safely store
                        your coins was difficult. Also, if you wanted to make a large purchase or simply wanted to move
                        a significant amount of money from one place to another, the weight of gold and silver coins
                        made it challenging and nearly impossible to conceal. (Just sixteen hundred dollars in a
                        silver-coin economy would have weighed approximately one hundred pounds!)<a href="#fn2"
                            id="fnref2" class="footnote">[2]</a> As before, these two problems were eventually solved.
                        This time, the solution came from goldsmiths.</p>

                    <p>Goldsmiths already handled large stockpiles of gold and silver in their trade and had built very
                        strong and well-guarded vaults to protect those stockpiles. This made solving the first problem
                        (safe storage of gold and silver coins) a no-brainer. Goldsmiths began renting unused space in
                        their vaults to citizens who wanted to keep their coins safe until they were needed. The
                        goldsmith was happy to collect a fee from each depositor, and the depositors were happy to know
                        that their money was in good hands. Interestingly enough, the safe-storage solution ended up
                        solving the weight problem of using coins in trade as well.</p>

                    <p>When a citizen came in to deposit their coins for storage, the goldsmith would hand the depositor
                        a paper receipt as proof of their deposit. So, if a customer deposited $1,000 in gold coins,
                        they were given a receipt (or receipts) valued at $1,000 worth of gold. These receipts were
                        marked "payable on demand," meaning anyone, at any time, could come in and exchange the receipts
                        for gold. Because the receipts were literally as "good as gold," citizens began accepting them
                        as payment for products and services. From that point forward, the receipts became a new form of
                        money: receipt money. Though the receipts were only made of paper, each one was 100 percent
                        backed by gold (or sometimes silver) and, therefore, each receipt was a legitimate form of paper
                        money.</p>

                    <p>However, as time passed it became increasingly rare for individuals to cash in their receipts and
                        withdraw coins from the goldsmith's vault. Assuming their coins were safe and always available,
                        depositors had no reason to remove them. (They'd just have to find another safe place to store
                        them if they did.) Besides, it was much easier to use the receipt money in commerce. Nearly all
                        citizens preferred to carry a pocket full of the goldsmith's receipts to a pocket full of heavy
                        coins.</p>

                    <p>Now, put yourself in the goldsmith's shoes. The receipts that <em>you create</em> are trusted by
                        all. They're literally considered as "good as gold" and are accepted as payment for products and
                        services, just the same as if a person paid with a gold or silver coin. Although you do not
                        possess the power to create gold and silver coins "with the flick of a pen," you <em>do</em>
                        possess the power to create receipts that are every bit as valuable in trade. What do you do?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Fractional Money</h2>

                    <p>It wasn't long before goldsmiths realized that they could simply print up additional receipts for
                        their own benefit. This, of course, was an act of pure fraud. Each ounce of depositors' gold
                        held in the goldsmith's vault had a corresponding receipt that was issued to the gold's rightful
                        owner. Issuing additional receipts constituted a theft of purchasing power, and worse, it set
                        into motion the inevitable loss of the depositor's coins.</p>

                    <p>To illustrate, say a man walks into the goldsmith's shop, deposits $1,000 worth of gold, and
                        receives $1,000 worth of receipts in exchange. No problem there. An hour later, another man
                        comes into the goldsmith's shop, but he doesn't want to make a deposit; he wants to
                        <em>borrow</em> $1,000. The goldsmith agrees to the loan and issues the borrower $1,000 worth of
                        <em>new</em> receipts, which are created on the spot. There is now $2,000 worth of receipts, but
                        only $1,000 worth of gold in the vault.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now imagine that the borrower takes his newly created $1,000 worth of receipts to a local store
                        and spends them. And say the store owner decides he'd rather have the actual gold coins instead
                        of the paper. So, he takes the receipts to the goldsmith, cashes them in for coins, and goes on
                        his way. Everyone is happy to this point. But what happens if an hour later the man who made the
                        original $1,000 gold-coin deposit shows up to withdraw his coins? Too bad for him. His gold
                        walked out the door an hour earlier when the <em>loaned</em> receipts (created without a
                        corresponding deposit) were cashed in.</p>

                    <p>This is a highly simplified example, but it illustrates the problem that emerged with the
                        creation of paper-receipt money: it opened the door to fraud. What began as a legitimate form of
                        paper money, backed 100 percent by coins held in reserve, eventually turned into <em>fractional
                            money</em>. And as the goldsmith printed more and more receipts, the <em>fraction</em> of
                        coins backing those receipts became less and less.</p>

                    <p>Before long, citizens were unknowingly accepting receipts backed by only half of the receipt's
                        printed value, a quarter of its printed value, a tenth of its printed value. When people finally
                        figured out what was going on, they rushed to exchange their receipts for the coins that
                        rightfully belonged to them. Of course, only the first few in line were able to withdraw their
                        gold and silver. All the rest were left holding worthless paper.</p>

                    <h2>Fiat Money</h2>

                    <p>In the previous example, people accepted paper receipts in exchange for their products and
                        services for one reason: they thought that they could cash in their receipts for gold or silver
                        coins whenever they wanted. None of them knew that they were essentially selling their goods for
                        inadequately backed pieces of paper. If they had known the receipts were fraudulent, they
                        wouldn't have accepted them; they would have demanded actual coins instead. Clearly, they were
                        ripped off.</p>

                    <p>Again, in an economy that uses <em>only</em> commodity money (as opposed to paper money), it is
                        very difficult to rip people off because the actual commodity must be surrendered at the time of
                        purchase. The trade is transparent. But in the aforementioned receipt-money economy, only the
                        <em>assumption</em> of transparency exists. Yes, the receipt <em>might</em> actually be
                        legitimate; it might represent an underlying commodity that physically exists and does not
                        belong to anyone else. However, it might also be illegitimate. You might sell an ounce of gold
                        for a more-convenient receipt that's marked "one ounce of gold," only to find out later that
                        your receipt can't be redeemed for anything. If this happens, it's very clear who won and who
                        lost in the exchange. (What thief wouldn't want to trade worthless receipts for as many ounces
                        of gold as he could get? Printing paper receipts is very easy…Printing gold is impossible.)
                    </p>

                    <p>This reminds us of what money is <em>supposed</em> to be: something that enables us to purchase
                        the products and services of others. The <em>only</em> reason we are willing to work for money
                        is because we believe the money we earn will serve this purpose. Nobody interested in earning
                        money would exchange their time and effort for pieces of paper that they <em>knew</em> to be
                        worthless. Therefore if somebody wants to use paper money to steal from others, the most obvious
                        way is to mislead them into believing that the money has value. However, <em>fiat money</em>
                        provides another way to steal: good old-fashioned government force.</p>

                    <p>Encarta defines fiat money as: "paper money that a government declares to be legal tender
                        although it is not based on or convertible into coins."</p>

                    <p>Another way to put that would be: fiat money is paper money, backed by nothing, and the
                        government forces people to accept it via legal tender laws. It's basically the goldsmith's
                        counterfeit receipts on steroids. Whereas the goldsmith had to conceal the fact that he was
                        fraudulently printing money to enrich and empower himself, fiat money enables a group like the
                        Network to openly print money and force it down people's throats. They simply use their
                        law-making ability to <em>legalize</em> the scam.</p>

                    <p>Whether by fraud or by fiat, the power to print money is the power to steal whatever money can
                        buy. Fiat money is more egregious because, unlike fraud, it is backed by force and can be used
                        to openly confiscate purchasing power on an enormous scale. (There is no doubt that the Network
                        advanced its position significantly when it moved the United States from a gold- and
                        silver-backed money supply to a purely fiat model.) But believe it or not, there is actually
                        something worse than fiat paper money. And this brings us to the final form of money we'll be
                        discussing in this "crash course," the form of money we use today—debt money.</p>

                    <h2>Debt Money</h2>

                    <p>Take the inherently fraudulent characteristics of the goldsmith's fractional money system, add in
                        the greater fraud and <em>force</em> of pure fiat, top it off with a mechanism designed to
                        generate inescapable debt, and presto: you've got the most sophisticated monetary-enslavement
                        system ever devised by man. And, wouldn't you know, you also have all the components that make
                        up our current monetary system.</p>

                    <p>Unlike a normal fiat money system (where the ruling class simply creates its own worthless paper
                        money, spends it into the economy, and demands that everyone accept it), our ruling class has
                        devised something much more powerful. Rather than <em>spend</em> money into our economy, they
                        <em>loan</em> money into our economy. This enables the Network to steal purchasing power from us
                        twice: once when they create new money, and again as they collect interest on the
                        <em>entire</em> money supply.
                    </p>

                    <p>Worst of all, by creating money and putting it into circulation <em>only</em> when a loan is
                        made, and then <em>destroying</em> that same money (removing it from circulation) when the loan
                        is repaid, the Network has designed the perfect debt trap. Any meaningful attempt to escape this
                        debt trap, by paying down debt, will trigger an automatic "correction mechanism" that
                        <em>guarantees</em> failure. The chain of events is perfectly predictable: as the nation repays
                        its banking debts (and refuses to take out new loans), the economy's debt-based money supply
                        will shrink. This will cause disruptions in the economy; initially the disruptions will be
                        minor, but they will inevitably become intolerable if new money isn't injected via new loans.
                        (Imagine the consequences of a 10 percent reduction in the nation's money supply…now imagine a
                        40 percent reduction, a 60 percent reduction, or an 80 percent reduction.)
                    </p>

                    <p>Theoretically, if new loans are not issued to reverse the automatic "correction mechanism" that
                        the Network has built into the system, and if all available funds continue to be applied toward
                        extinguishing Network-created debt, then the debt-based money supply must eventually fall to
                        <em>zero</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Robert Hemphill was the credit manager of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. In the foreword to
                        a book by Irving Fisher, entitled <em>100% Money</em>, Hemphill said this:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>If all the bank loans were paid, no one could have a bank deposit, and there would not be a
                            dollar of coin or currency in circulation. This is a staggering thought. We are completely
                            dependent on the commercial banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have…If the banks
                            create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not, we starve. We are absolutely without
                            a permanent money system. When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the tragic
                            absurdity of our hopeless situation is almost incredible—but there it is.<a href="#fn3"
                                id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Needless to say, the economic and political power that flows from this system is nothing short of
                        obscene. Therefore, it's easy to understand why the Network built this system like a prison.
                        Playing by their rules, we cannot escape; we can <em>never</em> repay the debt that is owed. And
                        just like the debt slaves of nineteenth-century India, this inescapable debt is binding on our
                        children, and our children's children, and so on…forever.</p>

                    <p>Of all the Network's monetary powers, <em>this</em> particular power is the most destructive. In
                        nation after nation, politicians who are happy to bury their citizens in debt are supported by
                        the Network and placed into positions of power. Some of the politicians are well intentioned;
                        others are not. In the end it really doesn't matter. As politically motivated spending programs
                        (from warfare to welfare) spiral out of control, it isn't long before massive monthly loans are
                        needed just to cover the day-to-day operating costs of government. The noose is then tightened
                        further with a never-ending slate of <em>new</em> spending programs that are added year after
                        year, decade after decade. Out of the crushing debt that ensues, and the subsequent need for an
                        endless supply of new loans to keep the bankrupt system afloat, the Network secures its dominant
                        position over everything and everyone that depends on its money.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime, the illiterate debtors of the world slave away with no idea that the money they
                        "owe" was created out of thin air; it was never <em>earned</em> by the lender. They have no idea
                        that the system itself was designed to create an ever-expanding black hole of debt, a system of
                        financial servitude that is literally inescapable.</p>

                            of economic conquest. They've proven their ability to seize control of nations large and

                    <h2>How Many Are Willing to Fight?</h2>

                    <p>There isn't enough room here to cover how inflation, deflation, booms, busts, and bailouts all
                        provide additional ways for the Network to transfer wealth and power into its own hands. For
                        now, it's enough to reiterate the opening claim of this chapter: money is the root of the
                        Network's power. For them to dominate "all the habitable portions of the world,"<a href="#fn5"
                            id="fnref5" class="footnote">[5]</a> they absolutely <em>must</em> maintain their ability to
                        confiscate, create, and control the money that we earn. And since they will never surrender
                        these monetary weapons willingly, our only choice is to forcibly disarm them.</p>

                    <p>The Network is literally composed of criminals who hide behind the "legitimacy" of government to
                        <em>force</em> their will on us all. Their power over our debt-money system, their power to tax
                        our incomes and wage war on national sovereignty, their relentless expansion of the government
                        that <em>they</em> control—all of this power has been taken by force and fraud. They're not
                        going to turn the "government power" they have created against themselves (any more than an
                        armed robber would turn his own gun against himself in defense of his victims). No, to reclaim

                    </p>

                    <p>Time and time again, history has shown that the predator class will do whatever is necessary to
                        gain and keep the reins of power. In fact, those who subscribe to the concept of "survival of
                        the fittest" would almost certainly argue in the Network's defense. Its members have studied
                        rulers of the past, improved upon ancient techniques of propaganda and mass manipulation, and
                        have thus <em>earned</em> their right to rule. Following this logic, the same
                        survival-of-the-fittest crowd would argue that the masses belong exactly where they are:
                        <em>beneath</em> the ruling class. Without the willful ignorance, indifference, and timidity of
                        the subjugated, our rulers simply could not exist. It is a symbiotic relationship, one of
                        parasite and host. Society's refusal to even acknowledge (let alone remove) the bulging tick
                        that's stuck to its forehead is akin to consent. This being the case, why shouldn't the Network
                        continue gorging itself?
                    </p>

                    <p>Does this position blame the victims? Perhaps…but sometimes the victims deserve a little blame.
                    </p>

                    <p>The typical voter has chosen to accept a fairly obvious lie: that the government is an instrument
                        of <em>the people</em>, that it is subject to the <em>will of the governed</em>, and nobody
                        (inside or outside of government) is above the law. To these voters, the idea of a highly
                        organized shadow government, operating at the direct expense of the governed, is laughed off
                        without investigation. They might passionately believe that Republicans are corrupt and only the
                        Democrats can save them, or that Democrats are corrupt and only Republicans can save them, but
                        they have yet to recognize the deeper truth: neither Republicans nor Democrats are ever going to
                        save them. Both sides are funded and maintained by the same ruling class to create the
                        <em>illusion</em> of choice.
                    </p>

                    <p>To really drive this point home, let's revisit a few earlier quotes. First from Quigley:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It is increasingly clear that, in the twentieth century, the expert <strong>will replace…the
                                democratic voter in control of the political system</strong>…Hopefully, the elements of
                            choice and freedom may survive for the ordinary individual in that he may be free to make a
                            choice between two opposing political groups (even if these groups have little policy choice
                            within the parameters of policy established by the experts)…<strong>in general, his freedom
                                and choice will be controlled within very narrow alternatives</strong>.<a href="#fn7"
                                id="fnref7" class="footnote">[7]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>And again, our "expert" on scientific manipulation, Bertrand Russell, takes the concept of hidden
                        power a step further: the experts will not only target the electorate for manipulation, they
                        will target the <em>elected</em> as well:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The government, being an oligarchy…<strong>may invent ingenious ways of concealing its own
                                power</strong>, <strong>leaving the forms of democracy intact, and</strong>
                            <strong>allowing the plutocrats or politicians to imagine that they are cleverly controlling
                                these forms</strong>…whatever the outward forms may be, <strong>all real power will come
                                to be concentrated in the hands of those who understand the art of scientific
                                manipulation.</strong><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote">[8]</a>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Finally, from the father of propaganda himself, Edward Bernays:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>The conscious manipulation of the masses</strong> is an important element in
                            democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an
                            invisible government which is <strong>the true ruling power of our country.</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>To summarize the substance of this problem: the majority of the population does not understand
                        how they're being manipulated, nor do they see a bulging tick stuck to society's forehead. They
                        see only the image of <em>government</em> that the "true ruling power" wants them to see. And if
                        they continue turning exclusively to the same ruling power for all of their information, their
                        perception will never change. That's why, if we want as many fighters as possible, we're going
                        to have to speak up. We're going to have to counter the "conscious manipulation of the masses."
                    </p>

                    <h2>Solutions—Where to Begin</h2>

                    <p>This short section of the book will be the easiest to write. That's because there isn't anything
                        particularly complicated about how to free ourselves from financial and political servitude.<a
                            href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a> In a nutshell, it boils down to this: the
                        Network's empire is built entirely on stolen financial power and manufactured consent.
                        <strong>Our objective is to undermine both of these, one mind and one dollar at a time, until
                            the Network can no longer defend itself in any meaningful way</strong>. That's it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now, the question becomes: What are the steps we should take to achieve this objective? Although
                        there are many options, implementation of the following will absolutely devastate the Network's
                        power.</p>

                    <h2>1. Raise Awareness: Expose Their Illegitimacy</h2>

                    <p>This is not only the easiest step; it is arguably the most important. Reach out to new people
                        regularly and share information that exposes what the Network is and how it operates. When you
                        encounter individuals who either refuse to look at the facts, or who minimize the significance
                        of what's presented, do not take it personally. If they attack you, do not take it personally.
                        In most cases, they are simply defending their world view…It has nothing to do with
                        <em>you</em>. Simply move on and know that <em>every single person</em> that is exposed to this
                        information, even those who initially resist, <em>could</em> become an ally down the road. The
                        same cannot be said of those who are never exposed to the truth.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Competing Currencies: Stop Using the Network's Money</h2>

                    <p>"End the Fed!" is the rallying cry of millions who have learned how the Network's "Federal
                        Reserve System" was created and how it operates. This privately owned and controlled money
                        machine has been rightfully identified as the heart of the enemy's power. To truly disarm the
                        Network, we first must <em>end</em> its ability to create and control our money supply. This can
                        be done, but it won't be easy.</p>

                    <p>The good news is that anti-Fed sentiment is growing every day. The bad news is that the Network
                        is already manipulating this sentiment, steering well-intentioned critics toward
                        <em>nationalizing</em> the Fed. But nationalizing the Fed will not end its ability to create and
                        control our money supply. In fact, this is the same tactic the Network used with the Central
                        Bank of England when demands to end its private ownership reached a fevered pitch. Though
                        nationalization <em>did</em> end outright private ownership of the bank, it did little to affect
                        the Network's <em>control</em>.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>For an idea of how <em>nationalization</em> of the Fed would unfold in the United States, flash
                        back to how the Federal Reserve System was created in the first place (in response to public
                        demands for financial reform, covered in chapter 4). The <em>visible</em> US government will
                        spring into action to "protect the people" from out-of-control bankers, and it will accomplish
                        the exact opposite in the process.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>

                    <p>Our best move against the Network's control of our money supply is to begin developing and using
                        competing currencies—money that literally <em>competes</em> with the Network's fraudulent debt
                        money that circulates in the economy. This move accomplishes two important functions: (1) it
                        cuts the Network out of the equation when we buy and sell from one another, and (2) it protects
                        us in the event of a Network-initiated run on the dollar.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12"
                            class="footnote">[12]</a></p>

                    <p>Gold and silver are the two most obvious forms of money that we could begin using, and some
                        states, aware of the dangers of the current monetary system, have begun pushing legislation that
                        will make gold and silver legal tender again. But gold and silver aren't the only options.
                        Digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and even Dogecoin<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13"
                            class="footnote">[13]</a> are gaining traction among millions of citizens around the world,
                        without any sanction from government whatsoever.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14"
                            class="footnote">[14]</a> In addition to these digital currencies, there is also the option
                        of competing private currencies, community currencies, time-based currencies, and so on.</p>

                    <p>The key point is to remember why the Network created central banks in the first place: to control
                        "the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole."<a href="#fn15"
                            id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a> The sooner we develop effective ways to trade outside
                        of their system, the sooner their system will become irrelevant and we can ignore it into
                        oblivion.</p>

                    <h2>3. Attack the Income Tax</h2>

                    <p>In chapter 4, we went over how the Network, approximately one hundred years ago, began stealing
                        massive amounts of money for its global-domination project. It called the theft "income tax" and
                        has glorified the annual expropriation as a citizen's "moral duty" ever since.</p>

                    <p>It's beyond the scope of this text to delve into how the Network, acting through its
                        <strong><em>tax</em></strong><strong>-</strong><strong><em>exempt</em></strong> foundations, has
                        used education to build public support for this previously illegal confiscation of wages.<a
                            href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote">[16]</a> Suffice to say, using government as its
                        instrument, the Network can now funnel trillions of dollars each year into furthering its own
                        interests. From multitrillion-dollar banker bailouts, to the approximately one hundred million
                        dollars <em>per hour</em> gushing into the military industrial complex,<a href="#fn17"
                            id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a> the Network can legally accomplish things with
                        "government taxation" and "government policy" that it could never accomplish privately.
                    </p>

                    <p>Of course, <em>private power</em> disguised as government power is hardly a new phenomenon, and
                        those who founded the United States federal government did everything they could to protect us
                        from this problem. They knew that the more powerful the government became, the sooner it would
                        be corrupted for private use. That is why our Constitution was written to <em>limit</em>
                        government power. Our Bill of Rights was written to <em>limit</em> government power. The
                        Founders' opposition to standing armies, their stance against fiat paper money, their aversion
                        to taxation—all of these served to <em>limit</em> government power and, by extension, the
                        inevitable private abuse of that power. Unfortunately, the Network has relentlessly undermined
                        or outright destroyed <em>all</em> of the aforementioned limits, one by one, since 1913.</p>

                    <p>This perfectly illustrates <em>why</em> we must sever, or severely disrupt, their so-called
                        "income-tax" funding mechanism. Forget the fact that it was foisted on the nation via fraud and
                        manipulation. Forget the fact that the revenue is being used to destroy (rather than protect)
                        the substance of our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Instead, view the argument against a
                        compulsory income tax purely from the angle of a <em>power</em> relationship. View it the way
                        the Network views it: if the citizenry can <em>force</em> the "government" to obey its wishes
                        (by cutting off access to money), then the citizens have the final say on whether or not a
                        policy decision will survive. However, if men with power can simply confiscate whatever amount
                        of money they want (via taxes or via the printing press), then the citizens have lost their most
                        effective nonviolent method of control. Yes, they can still express massive disapproval, as they
                        did in the case of the most recent banker bailouts, but this means nothing. As long as the
                        complaints are submitted with <em>payment in full</em>, and all of the outrage over the
                        government's refusal to listen falls on easily replaceable representatives, the Network's power
                        remains undisturbed.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, each individual must decide how to attack the income-tax issue. I myself decided to
                        cut my income drastically, eventually reducing the amount of money I "owed" to zero.<a
                            href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a> This is probably too radical for most
                        people, and there are certainly other options. Some find legal ways to reduce their income
                        taxes; others engage in not-so-legal ways. Some continue "paying with complaint" (which is at
                        least better than paying <em>without</em> complaint), while others flatly refuse to pay at all.
                        Last but not least, competing currencies also provide an option because they enable citizens to
                        conduct trade outside of the Network's financial system. Whether it's with gold and silver
                        coins, or semianonymous digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Dogecoin, the inability of
                        the Network to easily track these transactions makes it difficult for its members to calculate
                        what is "owed."<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a> It's then up to the
                        citizens to decide what duty they have to disclose their private financial affairs to men who
                        are openly trying to enslave them.</p>

                    <p>It goes without saying that the founding fathers would have considered the income tax an
                        unconstitutional abomination. It goes without saying that the Network used its illegitimate
                        influence to foist this tax on the American people. It should have never existed. It ought to be
                        repealed and replaced with, preferably, nothing. (The Federal government carried out its
                        <em>intended</em> role in our society, without an income tax, for more than a century. It can do
                        so again.)
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Nullification: Refuse to Comply, Refuse to Convict</h2>

                    <p>Practically forgotten, the extremely powerful weapon of <em>nullification</em> has recently been
                        dusted off and is being put to good use. The concept behind nullification is very simple:
                        <em>the people</em> determine what the government has the power to do, not the other way around.
                        When policy makers in Washington grant themselves "legal authority" to do things that violate
                        the legal restrictions on their power, the people have the right and the <em>duty</em> to
                        restrain them.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Two dozen American states nullified the REAL ID Act of 2005. More than a dozen states have
                            successfully defied the federal government over medical marijuana. Nullification initiatives
                            of all kinds, involving the recent health care legislation, cap and trade, and the Second
                            Amendment are popping up everywhere.</p>

                    <p>State nullification, even the <em>threat</em> of state nullification, is a tool that has been
                        used effectively for hundreds of years in this country. From the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798
                        to the unconstitutional searches and seizures of 1807–1809, from resistance to conscription in
                        1812 to the northern states' obstruction of the fugitive-slave laws, nullification has provided
                        a nonviolent way for citizens to push back against federal overreach.<a href="#fn21"
                            id="fnref21" class="footnote">[21]</a> But state nullification isn't our only option.
                        Another form is <em>jury</em> nullification, and it has the potential to be even more powerful.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Jury nullification occurs when a jury concludes that a defendant is technically guilty, but
                            fails to convict the defendant on the grounds that the law in question is unjust. While jury
                            nullification is legal, judges frequently do not inform juries of this power…<a href="#fn22"
                                id="fnref22" class="footnote">[22]</a></p>

                        <p>In the United States, jury nullification first appeared in the pre-Civil War era when juries
                            sometimes refused to convict for violations of the Fugitive Slave Act. Later, during
                            Prohibition, juries often nullified alcohol control laws, possibly as often as 60% of the
                            time. This resistance may have contributed to the adoption of the Twenty-first amendment
                            repealing Prohibition…<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote">[23]</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>To demonstrate the enormity of this <em>direct</em> power we were given over our government,
                        imagine the following hypothetical scenario: I am a juror, and you have been dragged into court
                        for refusing to pay your taxes to the Network's collection instrument (the IRS.) Unrepentant,
                        you stand and state the following: "I will no longer voluntarily fund an institution that
                        violates the law with impunity and engages in morally reprehensible behavior. I will no longer
                        be complicit in crime. I would rather be punished for obeying my conscience than be rewarded for
                        ignoring it."</p>

                    <p>It's very unlikely that your defense attorney would support this approach, but remember that this
                        is just a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate the power we <em>still possess</em> as citizens.
                        If I'm a juror in this case, you better believe that I am going to argue for nullification. If
                        that fails, I am going to ensure a hung jury. There will be no conviction this time around. Now,
                        multiply that same scenario a couple dozen times, then a couple hundred times, and then a couple
                        thousand times…the power over our incomes, <em>stolen</em> by the Network in 1913, will be
                        rightfully returned to the people. (Laws that cannot be successfully prosecuted cannot survive.
                        Nullification is our final nonviolent check on the abuse of government power.)</p>

                    <h2>5. Disruptive Technologies</h2>

                    <p>Over the past 100 years, the Network has worked very hard to monopolize our money, media,
                        medicine, manufacturing, education, energy, agriculture, and government. But all of this
                        top-down centralized power is currently under attack. It's being destroyed; not by armies, but
                        by innovation.</p>

                    <p>As of now, the most obvious and widespread example of this monopoly-destroying power is the
                        internet. Although the Network can still use its legacy-media empire to spread lies, the
                        internet has dramatically cut the lifecycle of those lies. Also, thanks to the internet, the
                        Network has lost its ability to stop whistleblowers, hackers, and ordinary citizens from
                        exposing its crimes. (Before, it could simply refuse to distribute the evidence against it.
                        Today, we can distribute the evidence ourselves; we can reach around the world instantly, at
                        nearly zero cost.) In all of human history, rulers have never faced a threat of this magnitude,
                        and it's only just beginning.</p>

                    <p>We are now entering an era of technological development that many believe will lead to
                        "exponential disruption." All of the aforementioned choke points of control (from energy to
                        education, medicine to manufacturing, agriculture to government) will change dramatically in the
                        next 20 – 30 years. The most beneficial characteristic of these technology-driven changes is
                        that they, like the internet, will decentralize and redistribute power. They will weaken, and
                        then replace, the immoral and inadequate centralized systems that our rulers have created.</p>

                    <p>Simply stated, to disrupt the elite, we must continue decentralizing everything they have
                        monopolized. We must build the competing / parallel systems that will eventually render their
                        current systems irrelevant. And here is where the issue of "raising awareness" really shows its
                        importance. For every 1 million people that "wake up," there will be a very small number who
                        fully apply their talents (in their areas of expertise) toward creating solutions. As more join
                        the fight, more solutions will emerge. Equally important are the millions who are "awake" but
                        aren't actively developing solutions. Why? Because they will provide the vital base of early
                        adopters; they will be the ones who support the emerging alternatives.</p>

                    <p>By the time 10 to 15 percent of the adult population begins to support and apply the tactics
                        outlined in this chapter, the Network's continued illegitimate control will become unmanageable.
                        But this army of informed and engaged citizens isn't going to magically appear. We have to make
                        it happen. And as we're making it happen, those who currently hold power will attack our efforts
                        with every lie and dirty trick in the book; but that doesn't matter. If we intend to take back
                        what "false and designing men"<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote">[24]</a> have
                        stolen, we must be prepared to <em>demand</em> it. If we hope to achieve our ends via nonviolent
                        means, the time to act is <strong><em>now</em></strong>…and if a violent confrontation proves
                        unavoidable, we can rest assured that the <em>nonviolent</em> work we have done will provide the
                        foundation for our success.</p>

                    <p>To clarify the importance of resistance, I will cover the incredible lawlessness and immorality
                        of those we're up against in the final chapters. Rather than focus on how they <em>might</em>
                        abuse their power, I'll focus on how they already have.</p>

                            dollar, it had to be a coin that contained nearly one ounce of fine silver
                            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar#United_States). The Network has nearly

                            will likely cause a dollar panic and then put the new currency forward as a

                        <p>[18] By 2003, I was painfully aware of the illegitimate nature of our federal government. Due
                            to the amount of money I was making at the time (roughly $500,000 per year), my so-called
                            income taxes, even after deductions, were running in excess of $100,000 annually. There is
                            no way I can express how <em>compromised</em> I felt each time I wrote one of those checks,
                            knowing full well that I was empowering individuals who were actively engaged in the
                            destruction of my country. So, I resolved to sell my business and do everything I could to
                            expose their crimes, living mostly off of savings and revenue from whatever assets I could
                            sell. Ten years later, I've finally run out of savings and assets, but I don't regret my
                            decision. It feels good to know, at the very least, I saved myself the angst of handing over
                            another $1 million
