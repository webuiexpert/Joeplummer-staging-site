  <h1>CHAPTER FIVE<br>Building a New World Order</h1>
</div>

<div class="Chapter-content">

          <p>So far, we've covered the game called <em>bailout</em> in some detail. We've shown how those engaged in
            reckless banking can turn the natural consequences of their actions into enormous profits. We've shown how
            you and I are ultimately the ones who provide those profits. But there is another kind of profit being
            gained at our expense.</p>

          <p>By weakening us financially, those who control our monetary system are incrementally increasing their
            leverage. A wealthy, proud, and independent nation would never willingly surrender its sovereignty. An
            economically compromised nation, struggling to maintain social order and vital services, is another story
            altogether.</p>

          <p>Such a nation would be far more willing to accept help from a global body like the United Nations or
            IMF/World Bank, regardless of the "structural adjustment" strings attached. And that is the ultimate profit
            being sought in this game. The real prize is political control.</p>

          <p>In nation after nation, these economic warriors make use of politicians who are willing to bury their
            citizens in debt. Out of that crushing debt, and the subsequent need for an endless supply of new loans,
            <em>true</em> sovereignty disappears.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Since this game results in a hemorrhage of wealth from the industrialized nations, their economies are
              doomed to be brought down further and further. ... The result will be a severe lowering of their living
              standards and their demise as independent nations.</p>

            <p>... The underdeveloped nations, on the other hand, are <em>not</em> being raised up. What <em>is</em>
              happening to them is that their political leaders are becoming addicted to the IMF cash flow and will be
              unable to break the habit. ... They are becoming mere components in the system of world socialism. ...
              Their leaders are being groomed to become potentates in a new, high-tech feudalism, paying homage to their
              lords. ... And they are eager to do it in return for privilege and power within the "New World Order."<a

          </blockquote>

          <h2>The role of the CFR</h2>

          <p>The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is perhaps the most visible cog in the New World Order machine. CFR
            members have openly and unapologetically called for the weakening of our economic and political sovereignty
            as a way to establish world government. Admiral Chester Ward, a long-time CFR member who later became a
            harsh critic, summed up the prevailing goal of the CFR this way: "The submergence of U.S. sovereignty and
            national independence into an all-powerful one-world government."<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"
              class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

          <p>Admiral Ward's assertion is backed by numerous references. Consider this a short list.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>[T]he "house of world order" will have to be built from the bottom up ... An end run around national
              sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.
            </p>

              "Foreign Affairs"<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Some dilution or leveling off of the sovereignty system as it prevails in the world today must take place
              ... to the immediate disadvantage of those nations which now possess the preponderance of power. ...
              <strong>The United States must be prepared to make sacrifices ... in setting up a world politico-economic
                order</strong>.

          <blockquote>
            <p>[S]ome international cooperation has already been achieved, but further progress will require greater
              American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a <strong>new world monetary structure</strong> will
              have to be undertaken with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world
                government will be achieved by consent or by conquest.</strong></p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>It's important to know wherever you find people in positions of power, you find the CFR. Griffin explains:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>[A]lmost all</strong> of America's leadership has come from this small group. That includes our
              presidents and their advisers, cabinet members, ambassadors, board members of the Federal Reserve System,
              directors of the largest banks and investment houses, presidents of universities, and heads of
              metropolitan newspapers, news services, and TV networks.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"
                class="footnote">[8]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>It requires an entire book to really understand the power and aims of the CFR. For more information on the
            topic, you can read or listen to "Tragedy and Hope 101" for free at JoePlummer.com.</p>

          <p>Before moving on, we must briefly cover the Trilateral Commission. Created by David Rockefeller in 1973,
            the Trilateral Commission has been called the little brother of the CFR, and it was established (no surprise
            here) to further assist in the creation of global government.</p>

          <p>However, unlike the CFR, the Trilateral Commission was specifically focused on bringing Pacific Asia into
            the global government equation. It has succeeded. Starting with Japan in 1973, the Pacific Asian branch now
            consists of members from Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
            China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as well as Australia and New Zealand.</p>

          <p>Former presidential candidate Barry Goldwater called the Trilateral Commission "David Rockefeller's newest
            cabal," and in speaking of its aims he said, "It is intended to be the vehicle for multinational
            consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the
            United States."<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>

          <p>When it comes to how the New World Order crowd ultimately plans to complete the creation of their one-world
            government, G. Edward Griffin cuts right to the chase:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The objective is to draw the United States, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Western Europe into political and
              economic union. Under slogans such as free trade and environmental protection, each nation is to surrender
              its sovereignty "piece by piece" until a full-blown regional government emerges from the process. ... Once
              that has happened, it will be a relatively simple step to merge the regionals into global government. That
              is the reality behind the so-called trade treaties within the European Union (EU), the North American Free
              Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation agreement (APEC), and the General Agreement
              on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Expanding on Griffin's assertion, the EU (European Union) provides a perfect example. What we now call the
            EU began as a simple trade agreement in 1951 between six European countries. That agreement was called The
            European Coal and Steel Community, and it established a "free trade area," where coal and steel could be
            bought and sold without import/export duties. (In that very limited sense, the agreement "erased the
            borders" between those member nations.)<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>

          <p>But in 1957, a new agreement was signed, and the concept of <em>cooperation</em> among member nations
            expanded significantly.</p>

          <p>The new agreement was called the European Economic Community, and its ultimate aim was the economic and
            eventual political merger of its member nations. (Policies on labor, social welfare, agriculture,
            transportation, foreign trade, etc., were to be "harmonized.")</p>

          <p>In 1992, the word "economic" was dropped and the organization became known as simply the "European
            Community." And finally, in 1993, the European Community became the European Union.</p>

          <p>What began as a simple trade agreement has now morphed into a supranational government entity that is more
            powerful than its member nations (of which there are now 27).</p>

          <p>These 27 member nations have already lost a great deal of control over their own countries, but the EU
            powerbrokers have far bigger things in mind. Look no further than a proposed European justice system for
            proof of that. Under Corpus Juris<em>,</em> the citizens of member nations would have:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>No right to trial by jury. The accused would go before a state appointed judge to be pronounced guilty
              or innocent.</li>

            <li>No right to habeas corpus. Anyone declared a suspect can be arrested without charges, and the suspect
              would have no right to challenge the legitimacy of their detention.</li>

            <li>The initial limit for how long the state could keep a "suspect" without presenting evidence was set to
              six months; however, that term could be extended, <em>and</em> there would be ...</li>

            <li>No protection against double jeopardy. Conceivably the state can continue arresting and trying suspect
              for the same crime until it secures a conviction.</li>

            <li>No presumption of innocence. Rather than the state having to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,
              suspects would be automatically presumed guilty.</li>

            <li>Even if you were fortunate enough to convince a judge that his comrades were wrong, you're right back to
              being potentially brought up on the same charge again.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>That these provisions were even put forward with a straight face provides some insight into the kind of New
            World Order our masters intend to build.</p>

          <p>For the elites looking to stifle and punish all dissent against them, this type of worldwide system would
            be a utopia. For all others, it would be an inescapable global hell.</p>

          <p>Sadly, many of these concepts of "justice" have already found a home in the United States. It looks as if
            the intellectual elite driving U.S. policy have outperformed the EU bureaucrats in this regard.<a
              href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>

          <p>Again, the EU perfectly illustrates how the framework for global government is being put in place. Nations
            are convinced to sign on to "trade agreements" that, in effect, give a newly created supranational
            government entity control over them. Once a handful of these new entities are in place — a European Union,
            North American Union, Asia-Pacific Union, etc. — merging those supranational governments into a one-world
            government will be a relatively simple task. (Whether or not they are ever <em>officially</em> merged is
            irrelevant. In the end, a tiny group of elitists will be in complete control, and that is the ultimate aim.)
          </p>

          <p>Enough on the final play in this game; let's return now to the transfer of wealth that is helping set it
            up.</p>

          <h2>Panama</h2>

          <p>When Panama fell behind on its bank loans, the major banking interests that stood to lose money had a
            <em>brilliant</em> idea. Chase Manhattan Bank, First National of Chicago, Citibank, and a handful of others,
            went to Washington and pitched their solution. It was this: The Panama Canal, built at a tremendous cost in
            American dollars and American lives, would be given to the Panamanian government. The Panamanian government
            could then use the hundreds of millions in annual revenue generated by the canal to pay back the bankers.
          </p>

          <p>Many in the U.S. strongly opposed this giveaway, but in the end, Congress dutifully served its real
            masters. Once again, the politically well-connected and powerful insiders got their way.</p>

          <p>Regardless of where you stand on the issue of giving the canal to the Panamanian government, this fact
            remains: The citizens of America, yet again, bailed out the banks. (Hundreds of millions in annual revenue
            generated by the canal was given away, and that lost revenue, ever since, has been made up in one of two
            ways: taxes or inflation.)</p>

          <h2>Mexico</h2>

          <p>In 1982, Mexico announced it would have to halt payments on its $85 billion ($85,000,000,000.00) worth of
            debt. But not to worry, the Federal Reserve was standing by to save the day!</p>

          <p>$4.5 billion worth of new loans were arranged with $2.7 billion created out of nothing by the Federal
            Reserve itself.</p>

          <p>The commercial banks agreed to accept interest only payments for a couple years, and as a result of the new
            infusion of cash, the multimillion-dollar loan payments resumed. Of course, none of this fixed the
            underlying problems, so a few years later, Mexico was again behind on its payments. This time the banks
            agreed to postpone payments on $29 billion and issued $20 billion in new loans to replace/pay off some older
            debts. The game continued. Can you guess what happened next?</p>

          <p>Mexico announced it could not make payments on its debt, and the Federal Reserve came to the rescue again.
            This time, the head of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, met with Mexico's finance minister and agreed to a
            "currency swap" of over half a billion dollars to help Mexico get past its upcoming election. Specifically,
            the United States traded Mexico 600 million U.S. dollars for 600 million essentially worthless Mexican
            pesos.</p>

          <p>Mexico agreed to redeem the pesos for U.S. dollars at a later date, but could anyone reasonably believe
            that would happen? Griffin adds:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The importance of this loan was neither its size nor even the question of repayment. It was the manner in
              which it was made. First, it was made by the Federal Reserve <em>directly</em>, acting as a central bank
              for Mexico, not the U.S.; and secondly, it was done almost in total secrecy.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13"
                class="footnote">[13]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>When the currency swap failed to solve the problem, a new and even more imaginative move was implemented in
            1988: a debt swap. What followed would actually be funny if it wasn't so irritating. First, a brief
            explanation:</p>

          <p>The United States government offers Treasury bonds that pay no interest while you hold them, but when the
            bonds "mature" (when the day arrives that you're allowed to cash them in), they are worth much more than
            their original cost.</p>

          <p>So, for instance, imagine you purchased one of these Treasury bonds in the amount of $10,000. When the bond
            matures (say 20 years later), the government will owe you $70,000. Technically, this kind of bond is called
            a "zero-coupon" bond. With that brief explanation out of the way, here is how the debt swap with Mexico
            worked.</p>

          <p>Using $492 million, Mexico purchased U.S. Treasury bonds that, on maturity 20 years later, were guaranteed
            to pay $3.7 billion. Mexico then approached the banks that were holding a fortune in essentially worthless
            Mexican bonds with the following offer: "We will trade you the worthless bonds you're now holding for
            <em>new</em> bonds that have this $3.7 billion in U.S. securities backing them as collateral. How does a
            ratio of 1.4 to 1 sound?"
          </p>

          <p>As a very simple example, imagine one bank was holding $140 million in Mexican bonds that were never going
            to be paid. What Mexico was saying is this: "If you tear up that $140 million debt that we owe you, we'll
            give you (in exchange) $100 million in new bonds that are <em>backed by these U.S. bonds</em> we now own."
          </p>

          <p>Of course, the banks were eager to swap old worthless Mexican bonds for new U.S. guaranteed bonds. It
            reduced the bank's interest income a bit, but in the long run it guaranteed a fortune would be made. Pretty
            clever, huh?</p>

          <p>Now for the fun part: The $492 million that Mexico used to purchase the U.S. bonds came mainly from the
            IMF. In turn, that means <em>our government</em> put up the lion's share of the money used to buy the bonds
            in the first place. It essentially went half a billion deeper in debt and guaranteed to pay $3.7 billion 20
            years later, all so Mexico could keep making payments to the banks. But that didn't fix the problem either.
            Griffin continues:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The following year, Secretary of State, James Baker (CFR), and Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady (CFR),
              flew to Mexico to work out a new debt agreement that would begin to phase in the IMF as final guarantor.
              The IMF gave Mexico a new loan of $3.5 billion (later increased to $7.5 billion), the World Bank gave
              another $1.5 billion, and the banks reduced their previous loan values by about a third. The private banks
              were quite willing to extend new loans and reschedule the old. Why not? Interest payments would now be
              guaranteed by the taxpayers of the United States and Japan.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14"
                class="footnote">[14]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Do you see a pattern here? Let's hope so. And following that pattern, what do you think happened after the
            aforementioned $9 billion in additional loans were given? Do you think that money fixed the problem? We'll
            pick up in December of 1994.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>At the end of 1994, the game was still going. ...Once again Mexico could not pay the interest on its
              loans. On January 11, President Clinton (CFR) urged Congress to approve U.S. guarantees for new loans up
              to <strong>$40 billion</strong>. Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin (CFR) explained: "It is the
              judgment of all, including Chairman Alan Greenspan (CFR), that the probability of the debts being paid (by
              Mexico) is exceedingly high." But, while Congress debated the issue, the loan clock was ticking. Payment
              of $17 billion in Mexican bonds was due within 60 days, and $4 billion of that was due on the first of
              February! <em>Who</em> was going to pay the banks?</p>

            <p>This matter could not wait. On January 31, acting independently of Congress, President Clinton announced
              a bailout package of over <strong>$50 billion</strong> in loan guarantees to Mexico; $20 billion from the
              U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund, $17.8 billion from the IMF, $10 billion from the Bank of International
              Settlements, and $3 billion from commercial banks.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote">[15]</a>
            </p>

          <p>These stories are so common that to tell them all would become boring. By the early 1980's, Third-World
            governments owed three quarters of a trillion dollars, and dozens of them were behind on their payments. As
            of this writing, the total debt of developing nations is well into the <strong>trillions.</strong> Through
            it all, we find the same game and the same players.</p>

          <p>For instance, in 1987, Brazil was in default (again) on over $120 billion in debt. Despite having a fortune
            pass through its hands, the government was so broke it couldn't even put gas in its police cars.</p>

          <p>In 1989, President Bush Sr. (CFR) upped the ante by calling for debt forgiveness as a solution to the
            entire Third-World debt problem. (Debt forgiveness sounds very humanitarian, but let's not forget who we're
            dealing with. Few take the time to look at the strings attached to debt forgiveness or contemplate how those
            strings benefit the ones who are doing the "forgiving.") But returning to Brazil, a little over a decade
            later, President Bush's son (Bush Jr.) was pushing for another $30 billion IMF loan, backed by U.S.
            citizens, to <em>help</em> Brazil overcome its payment problems.</p>

          <p>In 1982, an IMF loan of $2.15 billion was necessary to <em>help</em> Argentina make a $2.5 billion payment
            it owed. Within a year of receiving this help, Argentina was again unable to keep up with its payments. The
            banks scrambled to arrange new terms, guarantees, and IMF loans. An additional $4.2 billion was loaned to
            cover interest payments and provide some political incentives. By 1988, Argentina had again stopped making
            payments on its loans. To make a long story short, by 2002, the IMF had bailed out Argentina to the tune of
            an <em>additional</em> $48 <strong>billion</strong>.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>It would be counterproductive to cover the same sordid story as it has unfolded in each country. Suffice
              it to say that the identical game has been played with teams from Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, Costa Rica,
              Morocco, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and almost every other less-developed country in the
              world.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote">[16]</a></p>

          <h2>The great deception</h2>

          <p>No world government would be complete without including Communist China and the former Soviet Union.
            However, before either of these nations could be merged into the New World Order puzzle, they required a
            serious image makeover. After all, citizens of the United States, as well as other western governments,
            would be unlikely to support the transfer of hundreds of billions of dollars to the <em>totalitarian enemies
              of freedom</em>. And as we already know, without the IMF/World Bank mechanism doing its job (transferring
            billions and acquiring the kind of cooperation that only billions of dollars will buy), everything becomes
            complicated.</p>

          <p>So maybe those "dangerous commies" could be persuaded to drop the open hostility, take a more moderate
            stance, and reap the financial and ideological rewards of doing so.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>[T]he apparent crumbling of Communism has created an acceptable rationale for the industrialized nations
              to now allow their lifeblood to flow into the veins of their former enemies. It also creates the
              appearance of global, political "convergence," a condition which CFR theoretician, Richard Cooper, said
              was necessary before Americans would accept having their own destinies determined by governments other
              than their own.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote">[17]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Communist China joined the IMF/World Bank in 1980, and by 1987, it was the IMF's second largest borrower.
            While billions of dollars were being funneled into China (supposedly to help fight poverty, develop natural
            resources, and improve living standards), the Chinese government was busy dumping billions into military
            development. In other words, China already <em>had the money</em>; it simply chose to spend it elsewhere,
            and IMF/World Bank loans only made it easier for it to do so.</p>

          <p>It's kind of odd. Back in the good old days, when government-forced abortions, interference in the free
            market, land confiscations, slave labor, prisoner organ harvesting, religious persecution, torture, and
            nearly zero tolerance for freedom of speech were a big deal, Communist China wasn't looked on favorably in
            the West.</p>

          <p>But now that China is one of our strongest trading partners, all of these things no longer seem to matter.
            This provides some priceless insight into how our governments <em>choose</em> our enemies. When it suits
            them to attack and vilify a nation, they do so with a vengeance. When it suits them to keep quiet, the
            silence is deafening.</p>

          <p>Then there is the former Soviet Union. Can anyone really say where all the Communists went? For nearly a
            century, there they were, the gravest threat the free world ever faced. Menacing and powerful, they
            maintained their control over the Russian people with force and violence, a tyrannical cabal that created
            and controlled the world's <strong>only other superpower;</strong> and then, in the blink of an eye, they
            all just went away?</p>

          <p>Nobody wants to rob the West of its proudest moment (its victory over Communism), but doesn't the magic
            vanishing act of "The Great Red Menace" warrant a little bit of scrutiny?</p>

          <p>Was our victory over Communism everything it was cracked up to be, or was it just a ruse? Did the
            totalitarian power brokers in Russia all simultaneously experience a profound ideological shift, or was the
            new term "social democrat" a calculated PR move aimed at softening the image of the former Communists to set
            the stage for <em>convergence</em>?<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote">[18]</a></p>

          <p>A few disposable leaders purged from the ranks, a new public image and promising rhetoric, a long awaited
            "nod" given to the greater wisdom of Western ways. ... Surely it would require more than that to convince
            the world that the threat of Communism had fallen. Apparently not.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>No other changes are required. Socialism remains the economic system of choice and, although lip service
              may be given to free-market concepts, the economy and all means of production remain under state control.
              The old Communists are now Social Democrats and, without exception, they become the leaders in the new
              system.</p>

            <p>The West rejoices and the money starts to move. ... [F]ormer Bolsheviks are now hailed by the world as
              great statesmen who put an end to the Cold War, brought freedom to their people, and helped to forge a New
              World Order.</p>

            <p>When did Communism depart? We are not quite sure. All we know is that one day we opened our newspapers,
              and it was accomplished. Social Democrats were everywhere. No one could find any Communists. ...Communism
              was dead. It was not killed by an enemy. It voted itself out of existence. It committed suicide!<a
                href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote">[19]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Whether the death of Communism was exaggerated or not is open to debate. What isn't debatable is since its
            death, the money has flowed like water. And to be clear here, we're not suggesting American banks and
            corporations weren't making money on humanitarian loan packages prior to the announced end of Communism.
            They certainly were. Just nowhere near as much.</p>

          <p>Example: In 1990, just prior to the collapse, President Bush Sr. announced all "sound American corporate
            investments" in Russia would be 100% insured (for free) with no limit on the amount of coverage.</p>

          <p>In other words, the bailout game had been expanded to include not just the banks but other industries as
            well. It was a promise that, when investments went sour, the taxpayers would pick up the bill. Now, far more
            people could get in on the lucrative "bet big; you cannot lose" government gravy train. Imagine being in
            charge of an operation like this:</p>

          <p>International agencies loan billions of dollars to the "social democrats." Nobody expects the loans to be
            repaid, but that isn't a problem. The taxpayers will take care of that. In exchange, the social democrats
            agree to spend the billions purchasing products and services from well-connected American corporations.</p>

          <p>In addition to this cozy little arrangement, corporations are offered 100% insurance on anything they
            invest in Russian projects. Such lucrative, risk-free contracts are not awarded based on merit, but on
            political connections. (Come on, you don't really expect those running the game to let <em>everyone</em> in
            on the easy money, do you?) And finally, when socialist mismanagement drives everything into the dirt, the
            federal government covers corporate profits and repayment of bank loans by extracting the money from the
            U.S. citizenry. Chalk up another win-win for everyone but us.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>There you have it: The Social Democrats get the goodies; the corporations get the profits, and the banks
              get the interest on money created out of nothing. You know what the taxpayers get!<a href="#fn20"
                id="fnref20" class="footnote">[20]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Whether the bailout takes place domestically or internationally, the same individuals (engaged in the
            deliberate destruction of national sovereignty) are guaranteed to profit. There are the direct and most
            visible profits (the actual dollars and cents transferred from their rightful owners to the conspirators
            themselves), and there are the less visible but more significant profits, acquiring the cooperation of
            influential leaders around the globe. The ultimate objective is the creation of an inescapable, financially
            controlled global tyranny, run by an unelected "intellectual elite and world bankers."</p>

          <p>Dr. Carroll Quigley, in his 1300-page book, "Tragedy and Hope," speaks with the authority of an elite
            insider. In no uncertain terms he exposes the aims of what he refers to as "the network."</p>

          <p>It is important to note his only real "difference of opinion" is in the network's secretive approach to
            securing its aims. In his own words:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for
              two years, in the 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of
              its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments ... [M]y chief
              difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21"
                class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>You and I are the targets in this game. As the network secretly conspires to manipulate, deceive, and
            literally enslave us all, we have a choice: We can allow them to create their <em>"</em>integrated global
            political and economic structure<em>"</em> (directed by, and for, the elite) or we can stop them.</p>

          <p>Our problem really isn't that complicated. It's not like trying to reverse the earth's orbit around the
            sun. These men created (and continue to expand) a fraudulent system for their own benefit. It has been built
            and sustained with human effort; it can be undone just the same. However, one thing we <em>will</em> need
            (to prevent them from simply repackaging their current scheme) is a deeper understanding of money and how it
            is being used against us. We'll cover that in the next chapter.</p>

              administration of G.W. Bush. However, those who hoped "constitutional scholar" Barack Obama would return
              the U.S. to sanity were undoubtedly amazed when he, in May of 2009, proposed a new unconstitutional policy
              of his own called "preventive detention." Under this new policy, the federal government asserted the right
              to imprison you indefinitely based on <em>zero</em> evidence of any crime whatsoever. That is, they sought
              the power to put you in a cage not because you committed a crime, not because you "conspired" or attempted
              to commit a crime, but because they believe you <em>might</em> decide to commit a crime in the future!

              provides an enormous amount of insight into how the CFR-connected banking elite establish and maintain
              their power. Discussing the early 1900s, Quigley says: "In addition to their power over government based
              on government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them
              to go by other pressures. Since most government officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice
              from bankers whom they considered to be experts in the field. The history of the last century shows ...
              that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice [bankers] gave to industrialists, was
              consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen, and the people
              generally. Such advice could be enforced, if necessary, by manipulation of exchanges, gold flows, discount
              rates, and even levels of business activity." For a condensed version of "Tragedy and Hope," read or
