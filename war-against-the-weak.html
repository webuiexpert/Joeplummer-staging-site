                        To perpetuate the campaign, widespread academic fraud combined with almost unlimited corporate
                        philanthropy to establish the biological rationales for persecution. Employing a hazy amalgam of
                        guesswork, gossip, falsified information [and] academic arrogance, the eugenics movement slowly
                        constructed a national bureaucratic and juridical infrastructure to cleanse America of its

                        had collaborated with the Department of Agriculture and numerous state agencies in an attempt to
                        breed a new race of Nordic humans, applying the same principles used to breed cattle and corn.

                    <p>
                        "The movement was called eugenics. It was conceived at the onset of the twentieth century and
                        implemented by America's wealthiest, most powerful and most learned men against the nation's
                        most vulnerable and helpless. Eugenicists sought to methodically terminate all the racial and
                        ethnic groups, and social classes, they disliked and feared. It was nothing less than America's
                        legalized campaign to breed a super race – and not just any super race. Eugenicists wanted a
                        purely Germanic and Nordic super race, enjoying biological dominion over others.

                    <p>
                        Nor was America's crusade a mere domestic crime. Using the power of money, prestige and
                        international academic exchanges, American eugenicists exported their philosophy to nations
                        throughout the world, including Germany. Decades after a eugenics campaign of mass sterilization
                        and involuntary incarceration of 'defectives' was institutionalized in the United States, the
                        American effort to create a super Nordic race came to the attention of Adolf Hitler.

                    <p>
                        Those declared unfit…did not know it, but they were connected to a global effort of money,
                        manipulation and pseudoscience that stretched from rural America right into the sterilization
                        wards, euthanasia vans and concentration camps of the Third Reich. Prior to World War II, the
                        Nazis practiced eugenics with the open approval of America's eugenic crusaders. As Joseph
                        DeJarnette, superintendent of Virginia's Western State Hospital, complained in 1934, 'Hitler is
                        beating us at our own game.'

                    <p>
                        Eventually, out of sight of the world, in Buchenwald and Auschwitz, eugenic doctors like Josef
                        Mengele would carry on the research begun just years earlier with American financial support,
                        including grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Institution. Only after the
                        secrets of Nazi eugenics horrified the world, only after Nuremberg declared compulsory
                        sterilization a crime against humanity, did American eugenics recede, adopt an enlightened view
                        and then resurface as 'genetics' and 'human engineering.' Even still, involuntary sterilization
                        continued for decades as policy and practice in America."

                    <p>
                        "If the Supreme Court would uphold Carrie Buck’s sterilization, the floodgates of eugenic
                        cleansing would be opened across the United States for thousands. Carrie’s destiny, and indeed
                        the destiny of eugenics, rested upon nine men – and most heavily on the one man who would
                        ultimately write the court’s opinion. That man was Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., considered
                        by many to be America’s clearest thinker and most important judicial authority."

                    <p>
                        Holmes wrote the words that would reverberate forever. 'It is better for all the world, if
                        instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their
                        imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The
                        principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian
                        tubes…Three generations of imbeciles are enough.' It was over. Carrie Buck was sterilized before
                        noon on October 19, 1927."

                        The totals from 1907 to 1940 now changed dramatically…by the end of 1940, no fewer than 35,878
                        men and women had been sterilized or castrated – almost 30,000 of them after <em>Buck v.

                    <p>
                        "The global effort to help women make independent choices about their own pregnancies was
                        dominated by one woman: Margaret Sanger…Sanger was an ardent, self-confessed eugenicist, and she
                        would turn her otherwise noble birth control organizations into a tool for eugenics, which
                        advocated sterilization of so-called defectives, mass incarceration of the unfit and draconian
                        immigration restrictions. Like other staunch eugenicists, Sanger vigorously opposed charitable
                        efforts to uplift the downtrodden and deprived, and argued extensively that it was better that
                        the cold and hungry be left without help, so that the eugenically superior strains could
                        multiply without competition from ‘the unfit.’ She repeatedly referred to the lower classes and
                        the unfit as ‘human waste’ not worthy of assistance, and proudly quoted the extreme eugenic view
                        that human ‘weeds’ should be ‘exterminated.’ Moreover, for both political and genuine
                        ideological reasons, Sanger associated closely with some of America’s most fanatical eugenic
                        racists."

                    <p>
                        Steeped in eugenic science, Sanger frequently parroted the results of U.S. Army intelligence
                        testing which asserted that as many as 70 percent of Americans were feebleminded. In January of
                        1932, the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> sent Sanger a quote from a British publication asserting
                        that one-tenth of England’s population was feebleminded due to ‘random output of unrestricted
                        breeding.’ In a letter, the <em>Eagle</em> editor asked Sanger, ‘Is that a fair estimate? What
                        percentage of this country’s population is deficient for the same reasons?’ Sanger wrote her
                        response on the letter: ‘70% below 15 year intellect.’"

                        know that environment and education can develop only what heredity brings.’ Stoddard’s solution?
                        ‘Just as we isolate bacterial invasions, and starve out the bacteria, by limiting the area and
                        amount of their food supply, so we can compel an inferior race to remain in its native habitat

                        Shortly after Stoddard’s landmark book was published in 1920, Sanger invited him to join the

                        "In the December 1924 <em>Birth Control Review</em>, another typical article, this one by
                        eugenicist John C. Duvall, was simply titled ‘The Purpose of Eugenics.’ In a section subtitled
                        ‘Dangerous Human Pests,’ Duvall explained…. ‘It is interesting to note that there is no
                        hesitation to interfere with the course of nature when we desire to eliminate or prevent a
                        superfluity of rodents, insects or other pests; but when it comes to the elimination of the
                        immeasurably more dangerous human pest, we blindly adhere to the inconsistent dogmatic doctrine
                        that man has a perfect right to control all nature with the exception of himself.’ It was the
                        second time that year that Sanger’s magazine had published virtually the same phrases declaring
                        lower classes to be more dangerous than rats and bugs. Such denunciations were commonplace in
                        <em>Birth Control Review.</em>"

                        "Their drive was not to reduce blindness arising from accident or illness, but to prevent the
                        far less common problem of ‘hereditary blindness.’ How? By banning marriage for individuals who
                        were blind, or anyone with even a single case of blindness in his or her family. According to
                        the plan, such individuals could also be forcibly sterilized and segregated – even if they were
                        already married. If eugenicists could successfully lobby for legislation to prevent hereditary
                        blindness by prohibiting suspect marriages, the concept of marriage restriction could then be
                        broadened to include all categories of the unfit…Eugenic leaders understood their campaign was
                        never about blindness alone. Blindness was only the test case to usher in sweeping eugenic
                        marriage restrictions."

                        "By 1921, the ERO and AMA Section subcommittee had drafted sweeping legislation that pushed far
                        beyond hereditary blindness or even general blindness. It targeted all people with imperfect
                        vision. Under the proposal, any taxpayer could condemn such a person and his family as
                        ‘defective.’ Such a measure would, of course, apply to anyone with blurry vision or even
                        glasses, or any family that included someone with imperfect vision. According to the plan, one
                        ophthalmologist and one eugenic practitioner, such as Laughlin, would render the official
                        assessment…The draft law read: ‘When a man and woman contemplate marriage, if a visual defect

                        quickly began using his office letterhead and the public’s uncertainty about the implications of
                        the new law to his advantage. His letters and bulletins informed and sometimes hounded new

                        ‘We have a report of the birth of your child, July 30th, 1923, signed by Mary Gildon, midwife.
                        She says that you are white and that the father of the child is white. We have a correction to
                        this certificate sent to us from the City Health Department at Lynchburg, in which they say that
                        the father of this child is a negro. This is to give you warning that this is a mulatto child
                        and you cannot pass it off as white. A new law passed by the last legislature says that if a
                        child has one drop of negro blood in it, it cannot be counted as white. You will have to do
                        something about this matter and see that this child is not allowed to mix with white children.

                    <p>
                        Plecker followed this with a short note to the midwife, Mary Gildon. ‘This is to notify you that
                        it is a penitentiary offense to willfully state that a child is white when it is colored. You
                        have made yourself liable to very serious trouble by doing this thing. What have you got to say
                        about it?’

                        On July 29, 1924, Plecker wrote to W.H. Clark, who lived at Irish Creek in Rockbridge County. ‘I
                        do not know you personally and have no positive assurance as to your racial standing, but I do
                        know that an investigation made some time ago by the Carnegie Foundation of the people of mixed
                        descent in Amherst County found the Clark family one of those known to be thus mixed. We learned
                        also that members of this family and of other mixed families have crossed over from Amherst
                        County and are now living on Irish Creek.’ After informing Clark that his ancestors included
                        ‘three Indians who mixed with white and negro people,’ Plecker asserted that the man was now one
                        of five hundred individuals who would be removed from the list of white people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adding a threat of prosecution, Plecker warned, ‘We do not expect to be easy upon anyone who
                        makes a misstatement and we expect soon to be in possession of facts which we can take into
                        court if necessary.’ Plecker seemed to enjoy taunting the racially suspect. He sardonically
                        added that he looked forward to tarring even more of Clark’s extended family. ‘I will be glad to
                        hear what you have to say,’ quipped Plecker, ‘and particularly to have the dates and places of
                        the births and marriages of yourself, your parents and grandparents.’"

                        Society about mass murder in lethal chambers. Shaw proclaimed, ‘A part of eugenic politics would
                        finally land us in an extensive use of the lethal chamber. A great many people would have to be
                        put out of existence, simply because it wastes other people’s time to look after them.’"

                    <p>
                        Leaders of the American eugenic establishment also debated lethal chambers and other means of
                        euthanasia. But in America, while the debate began as an argument about death with dignity for
                        the terminally ill or those in excruciating pain, it soon became a palatable eugenic solution.
                        In 1900, the physician W. Duncan McKim published <em>Heredity and Human Progress</em> asserting
                        ‘Heredity is the fundamental cause of human wretchedness…The surest, the simplest, the kindest,
                        and most humane means for preventing reproduction among those whom we deem unworthy of this high
                        privilege [reproduction], is a gentle, painless death.’ He added, ‘In carbonic acid gas, we have
                        an agent which would instantaneously fulfill the need.’"

                        By 1910, the idea of sending the unfit into lethal chambers was regularly bandied about in

                        Haiseldon continued to rally for eugenic euthanasia with a six-week series in the <em>Chicago
                            American.</em> He justified his killings by claiming that public institutions for the
                        feebleminded, epileptic and tubercular were functioning as lethal chambers of a sort. After
                        clandestinely visiting the Illinois Institution for the Feebleminded at Lincoln, Illinois,
                        Haiselden claimed that windows were deliberately left open and unscreened, allowing drafts and
                        infecting flies to swarm over patients. He charged that Lincoln consciously permitted ‘flies
                        from the toilets, garbage and from the eruptions of patients suffering from acute and chronic
                        troubles to go at will over the entire institution. Worse still,’ he proclaimed, ‘I found that
                        inmates were fed with the milk from a herd of cattle reeking with tuberculosis.’

                        At the time, milk from cattle with tuberculosis was a well-known cause of infection and death
                        from the disease. Lincoln maintained its own herd of seventy-two cows, which produced about
                        50,000 gallons of milk a year for its own consumption. Ten diseased cows had died within the
                        previous two years. State officials admitted that their own examinations had determined that as
                        many as half of the cows were tubercular, but there was no way to know which ones were infected
                        because ‘a tubercular cow may be the fattest cow in the herd.’ Lincoln officials claimed that
                        their normal pasteurization ‘by an experienced employee’ killed the tuberculosis bacteria. They
                        were silent on the continuous handling of the milk by infected residents."

                        he spent his time poring over eugenic textbooks, which extensively quoted Davenport, Popenoe and
                        other American raceological stalwarts. Moreover, he closely followed the writings of Leon
                        Whitney, president of the American Eugenics Society (AES), and Madison Grant, who extolled the
                        Nordic race and bemoaned its corruption by Jews, Negroes, Slavs and others who did not possess
                        blond hair and blue eyes. The young German corporal even wrote one of them fan mail.

                        prevent both the elimination of defective infants and the sterilization of such adults as are
                        themselves of no value to the community. The laws of nature require the obliteration of the
                        unfit and human life is valuable only when it is of use to the community or race.’

                        chairing a eugenic immigration committee. Whitney wanted to show off a letter he had just
                        received from Germany, written by the corporal, now out of prison and rising in the German
                        political scene. Grant could only smile. He pulled out his own letter. It was from the same
                        German, thanking Grant for writing <em>The Passing of the Great Race</em>. The fan letter stated
                        that Grant’s book was ‘his Bible.’

                        action. At the same time, by virtue of their blond and blue-eyed Nordic nature as well as their

                        plasm in lethal chambers. During the Reich’s first ten years, eugenicists across America
                        welcomed Hitler’s plans as the logical fulfillment of their own decades of research and effort.
                        Indeed, they were envious as Hitler rapidly began sterilizing hundreds of thousands and
                        systematically eliminating non-Aryans from German society.

                        Most of all, American raceologists were intensely proud to have inspired the purely eugenic
                        state the Nazis were constructing. In those early years of the Third Reich, Hitler and his race
                        hygienists carefully crafted eugenic legislation modeled on laws already introduced across
                        America, upheld by the Supreme Court and routinely enforced. Nazi doctors and even Hitler
                        himself regularly communicated with American eugenicists from New York to California, ensuring
                        that Germany would scrupulously follow the path blazed by the United States…As they followed the
                        day-to-day progress of the Third Reich, American eugenicists clearly understood their continuing
                        role. This was particularly true of California’s eugenicists, who led the nation in
                        sterilization and provided the most scientific support for Hitler’s regime.

                        In 1934, as Germany’s sterilizations were accelerating beyond five thousand per month, the
                        California eugenic leader and immigration activist C.M. Goethe was ebullient in congratulating
                        E.S. Gosney of the San Diego based Human Betterment Foundation for his impact on Hitler’s
                        work….Goethe wrote Gosney a letter of praise. ‘You will be interested to know,’ Goethe’s letter
                        proclaimed, ‘that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of
                        intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their
                        opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought, and particularly by the work of
                        the Human Betterment Foundation. I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for
                        the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million
                        people.’"

                        his frustration another way: ‘If Hitler succeeds in his wholesale sterilization, it will be a
                        demonstration that will carry eugenics farther than a hundred Eugenics Societies could. If he
                        makes a fiasco of it, it will set the movement back where a hundred eugenics societies can never
                        resurrect it.’"

                        hierarchy of hell, Buchenwald was considered among the worst of Nazi labor camps. Hundreds to
                        thousands of people died within its confines each week from beatings, disease, starvation,
                        exhaustion or execution.

                        known for its frosted windows and restricted access. Nazi doctors deliberately infected
                        prisoners with typhus, converting their bodies into so many living test tubes, kept alive only
                        as convenient hosts for the virus. Doctors then carefully observed the progress of the disease
                        in order to help evaluate potential vaccines…In addition, Russian POWs were deliberately burned
                        with phosphorus to observe their reactions to drugs…Experimental Section V employed gland
                        implants and synthetic hormones on homosexuals to reverse their sex drive…Those who survived
                        these heinous tests, or otherwise outlived their usefulness, were often murdered with injections
                        of phenol.

                        who did not die quickly enough were bludgeoned…Russian POWs were systematically shot in the back
                        of the neck through a small hole as they stood at the height-measuring wall…Death was an hourly
                        event at Buchenwald – ultimately more than 50,000 perished.

                        to disperse the ERO records. In January of 1948, the Dight Institute agreed to house the ERO’s
                        extensive individual trait and family documents if Carnegie would defray the expected $1,000

                        documents at a Cold Spring Harbor archive and retaining some others in Washington. When the

                        marriage on the basis of racial and eugenic laws. During the 1940s, some 15,000 Americans were

                        eugenics some nine years ahead. One writer urged new thinking on the subject, insisting, ‘The

                        Carolina changed its name to the Human Genetics League of North Carolina in 1984. In Britain
                        there were name changes as well. The <em>Annals of Eugenics</em> became the <em>Annuls of Human
                            Genetics</em> and is now a distinguished and purely scientific publication. The University
                        College of London’s Galton Chair of Eugenics became the Chair of Genetics. The University’s
                        Galton Eugenics Laboratory became the Galton Laboratory of the Department of Genetics. The
                        Eugenics Society changed its name to the Galton Institute.

                        In 1954, <em>Eugenical News</em> changed its name to <em>Eugenics Quarterly</em> and was renamed
                        again in 1969 to <em>Social Biology</em>. As of March 2003, both the organization and its
                        publication are operating out of university professors’ offices. <em>Social Biology</em> editors
                        and the leaders of the society are aware of their society’s history, but are as far from eugenic
                        thought as anyone could be. The group is now researching genuine demographic and biological
                        trends. Professor S. Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois at Chicago and <em>Social
                            Biology’s</em> associate editor as of March 2003, denounced eugenics and his journal’s
                        legacy during an interview with this reporter. ‘You couldn’t find anyone better to run this
                        society,’ he insisted. ‘I carry a potentially lethal genetic disorder. Plus, I’m a Jew. I would
                        be the exact target of any eugenics campaign.’"

                        "Prominent voices in the genetic technology field believe that mankind is destined for a genetic
                        divide that will yield a superior race or species to exercise dominion over an inferior subset
                        of humanity. They speak of ‘self-directed evolution’ in which genetic technology is harnessed to
                        immeasurably correct humanity – and immeasurably enhance it…But correction will not be
                        cheap…Hence, economic class is destined to be associated with genetic improvement. If the

                        benefits of society, then that will only increase their advantages.

                        Mass social engineering is still being advocated by eminent voices in the genetics community.
                        Celebrated geneticist James Watson, codiscoverer of the double helix and president of Cold
                        Spring Harbor Laboratories, told a British film crew in 2003, ‘If you are really stupid, I would
                        call that a disease. The lower 10 percent who really have difficulty, even in elementary school,
                        what’s the cause of it? A lot of people would like to say, “Well, poverty, things like that.” It
                        probably isn’t. So I’d like to get rid of that, to help the lower 10 percent.’

                        For the first half of the twentieth century, Cold Spring Harbor focused on the ‘submerged
                        tenth’; apparently, the passion has not completely dissipated."

                        acknowledges as much on page 400 when he notes that sterilizations can currently be traced to as
                        late as 1976: "According to a U.S. General Accounting Office study, hospitals in just four
                        cities sterilized 3,406 women and 142 men between 1972 and 1976. The women widely reported being
                        threatened with the loss of welfare benefits or custody of their children unless they submitted
                        to sterilization…During the same four-year period, one Oklahoma hospital alone sterilized nearly
                        8 percent of its fertile female patients."</p>

                        where their brute force and barbarity of the past failed. …If nothing else, campaigns to make
